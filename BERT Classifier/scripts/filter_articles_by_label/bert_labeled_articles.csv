This is known as asupply chain attack. The idea behind these attacks is to compromise a third-party piece of software from a VAR or systems integrator or infect an industrial process unbeknownst to IT. Shopping carts are attractive targets because they collect payment information from customers: if yourmalwarecan tap into this data stream, you have a ready-made card collection tool. Almost all ecommerce sites that use shopping carts don’t properly vet the code that is used with these third-party pieces — a recipe for a ready-made hack. Magecart is known to have been active since 2016 and is still quite prolific. RiskIQ has found evidence of its exploits going back to 2010. RiskIQ was acquired by Microsoft in 2021 and folded into Microsoft’s own threat research. Unfortunately, much of the original research isn’t available, although this2019 report gives a very comprehensive viewof the malware’s activities. The malware group’s activities intensified in 2018, and researchers saw hourly alerts for websites being compromised by its skimmer code. That earned Magecart a spot on Wired magazine’s list ofMost Dangerous People On The Internet In 2018. In 2023, Akamai researchers tracked new developments designed tosteal personal data from ecommerce websitesandabusing web error pages. In the first case, the Magecart attackers hijack legitimate websites to act as makeshift command and control servers, which act in turn as distribution centers for malicious code, effectively hiding the attack behind a legitimate domain. The second link describes subverting the 404 error page messages by injecting malware-laced code. Both situations add a further layer of obfuscation making Magecart harder to detect. Other Magecart attacks include: Ticketmaster’s UK operations(January 2018) British Airways(August 2018) NewEgg electronics retailer(September 2018) Shopper Approved(September 2018) MyPillow(October 2018) Topps sports collectable website(November 2018) Atlanta Hawks fan merchandise online store(April 2019) Hundreds ofcollege campus bookstores(April 2019) Forbes magazine subscribers(May 2019) NutriBullet(February 2020) WordPress/WooCommerce attacks(May 2020) Favicon code injection attack (May 2021) Targeting reCAPTCHA (August 2021) Exploiting Google Tag Managerand using a new vulnerability in Magento to deploy its skimmer code (2024) Typically, the Magecart hacker substitutes a piece of Javascript code, either by altering the Magento source or by redirecting the shopping cart using an injection to a website that hosts the malware.Researchers have identified nearly 40 differentcode-injection exploits. The only way to detect this is to compare the entire ecommerce code stack line-by-line and see what has changed. Its overall attack process has gotten very sophisticated, using a series of steps to hide its presence and deploy a variety of techniques to exfiltrate data. One clever way for attackers to host their malware (and, sadly, not limited to just Magecart attacks) is toupload their code to an unused GitHub project. The criminals try to take ownership of the project and then publish a “new” version of the code that contains the malware. This has a direct benefit of quickly getting malware in active use across thousands of websites. Security tools might not scan code from GitHub, so criminals can hide in plain sight and get away with the compromised project. In at least the British Airways hack, Magecart tailored the attack to the specific system, according to various reports. This included how the airline’s payment pages were constructed, meaning that they were targeted specifically. Magecart showed that it is willing to evolve further with its MyPillow website attack. MyPillow discovered and removed their original malware quickly, but Magecart retained access to the site according toa 2019 report from Trend Micro. A second attack changed tactics where the attackers placed a skimmer on the MyPillow website, adding a new script tag for LiveChat that matched a script tag usually inserted by the LiveChat scripts. The Magecart attackers went even further by proxying the standard script returned from the real LiveChat service and appended the skimmer code below it. Three of the 2019 and 2020 Magecart skimmers targeted the open-source WooCommerce plugin for WordPress, which is popular among online retailers. These skimmers were: WooTheme: This skimmer is simple and easy to use. Its code is typically obfuscated to avoid detection. Slect: This skimmer gets its name from a misspelling of the word “select” that helped researchers discover it. It’s another simple skimmer and believed to be a variation of the Grelos skimmer. Gateway: This skimmer uses multiple layers and steps to obfuscate its processes and avoid detection. Analysts from RiskIQ and Flashpoint combined forces in 2018 andpublished a reportthat dissects Magecart’s code and its methods of compromise. They continue to track at least six different hacking groups that are actively developing versions of the malware, adding various enhancements and trickery. Each group has its own distinctive code signature and methods so that researchers can classify them. That research has found a series of improvements in this malware family. Movement beyond Magento with new plug-ins.The attack on the Shopper Approved website was significant. Most of the Magecart efforts have involved compromises to the Magento shopping cart. This one leveraged the vendor’s customer scoring plug-in to rate various websites, which then displays a badge of honor. Researchers found that the malware was eventually deployed across more than 7,000 ecommerce sites. Once researchers identified the source of the infection, Shopper Approved moved quickly to remove the malware. Using ad servers. A second direction is still attacking shopping carts, but using a new method to infect advertising banners, so that ad servers will place Magecart code into a webserver. Once a user views the ad in a browser, the code is downloaded to their computer. The malware code can also be hosted by a compromised server. Using more targeted and more elaborate attacks.This shows a movement away from spraying malware widely and spending time with potential victims to study their coding and infrastructure. This is what happened with British Airways, when hackers were able to take advantage of the logic flow of their internal applications. Researchers were able to track 22 lines of code of an infected script that dealt with the British Airways baggage claim information page and came to the conclusion that they were seeing aXSSattack thatcompromised the British Airways’ own servers. Magecart was able to steal data that wasn’t stored on the British Airways-owned servers. They found the modifications because of an odd circumstance: The last time any of the baggage scripts had been modified prior to the breach was in December 2012. Dual exfiltration and payment form injection.RiskIQ documented in 2021the past and current activities of a Magecart group it calls Group 7 that has been operating since 2018. The group started out with a skimmer dubbed MakeFrame skimmer that they tested and constantly improved using victims’ websites. This skimmer stood out because it used dual data exfiltration paths to both compromised sites and actor-controlled servers. The researchers have managed to link more recent attacks with a skimmer dubbed Bom to Magecart Group 7. The new skimmer, which has been in use since last year and has been documented by other security firms as well, seems to be a predecessor to MakeFrame and shares similarities with it. Like MakeFrame, Bom uses dual exfiltration paths and even injects its own rogue payment forms into the compromised sites. Hiding its script in image files.This 2022research from Microsoftshows how images contain malicious code. While hackers can use sophisticated techniques to plant and hide skimmers, website owners with limited resources should not despair. There are free website scanners online that can help spot suspicious connections opened by scripts like Magecart and browser developer tools that can help analyze their contents. Researchers from Trustwave SpiderLabspublished a guidewith detailed information on how such investigations can be performed as well as a list of useful tools specifically designed for detecting and fixing Magecart infections. Web technologies like Content Security Policy (CSP) and Sub Resource Integrity (SRI) can also be used to protect website visitors, as they can be used to restrict where scripts are loaded from and to protect their integrity. These best practices will help harden your networks and try to stop Magecart and other supply chain attacks. Think about first identifying all your third-party ecommerce and online advertising vendors. You could require them to do self-assessments of their code or other audits. Implementsubresource integrityso that modified scripts are not loaded without your permission. This will require a concerted education of your devops teams and a thorough code review to track down these scripts. Host as many of your third-party scripts on your own servers as you can rather than on any of your suppliers’ servers. That is more easily said than done, given that the average ecommerce webpage has dozens of third-party sources. Vet your endpoint protection provider and determine if they can stop Magecart and other third-party compromise attacks. Make sure your cyber insurance covers this type of compromise. Review and revise your security policies to include the same treatment of your contractors and suppliers, as if they are full-time employees working directly for your corporation. This is one reason why the supply chain attacks work, because the hackers are counting on less-than-stellar security applying to these workers. If you are using WordPress, make sure you continue to update to the most recent version. Since v5.2 it specifically screens and tries to prevent supply chain attacks being used across their plug-in library.

How law enforcement agents gain access to encrypted devices,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3812874/how-law-enforcement-agents-gain-access-to-encrypted-devices.html,"From traditional investigative methods to zero-day exploits, authorities have a range of techniques at their disposal, including digital searches at borders, which could present concerns for CISOs. Access requests  Traditional investigative techniques Vulnerability exploits Backdoors Remote hacking Supply chain attacks Related content Governments won’t like this: encrypted messaging between Android and iOS devices coming, says GSMA GitHub to unbundle Advanced Security Aptori Now on Google Cloud Marketplace for AI-Powered Security and Automated Risk Remediation Trump nominates cyber vet Sean Plankey for CISA chief amid DOGE cuts and firings Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Accessing data on encrypted devices might seem like something out of a hacker or spy movie, but for law enforcement, it’s a very real challenge. The issue is of relevance to CISOs and other security professionals because workers on sales trips or attending conferences overseas might face demands to decrypt devices and present their contents at border crossings. Chinese border agents, for example, may use specialized equipment to extract data from devices, even if locked or encrypted. Contrary to films, brute forcing an encryption key is impractical — at leastpending the advent of powerful enough quantum computers. Modern encryption is pretty solid, but luckily for law enforcement and spy agencies the software and people using it are pretty fallible. Gaining access to a suspect’s mobile phone or computer is a high priority for law enforcement. When a mobile device is seized, law enforcement can request the PIN, password, or biometric data from the suspect to access the phone if they believe it contains evidence relevant to an investigation. In England and Wales, if the suspect refuses, the police can give a notice for compliance, and a further refusal is in itself a criminal offence under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA). “If access is not gained, law enforcement use forensic tools and software to unlock, decrypt, and extract critical digital evidence from a mobile phone or computer,” says James Farrell, an associate at cyber security consultancy CyXcel. “However, there are challenges on newer devices and success can depend on the version of operating system being used.” In general, law enforcement agencies gain access to encrypted devices (both PCs and mobile devices) using one of several general approaches: Traditional investigative techniques Exploiting vulnerabilities and zero days Backdoors Manufacturer cooperation Remote hacking Supply chain attacks The most straightforward approach is for law enforcement agencies to seize devices while in an “unlocked” state. Search and seizure of physical locations to find written passwords or unencrypted copies of data might also be possible. Surveillance to capture passwords or encryption keys as they are entered offers another conventional approach to access data on encrypted devices. Simply guessing the device password may or may not be viable depending on the retry lockouts, and the kind of password/locking mechanism chosen, but it’s a possibility. “This could involve brute force, dictionary attacks (testing likely passwords from past breaches using many combinations), or social engineering, such as stealing the password or shoulder surfing,” Jeff Watkins, CTO at digital consultancy CreateFuture, tells CSO. “Another option is to attack or obtain a warrant to access cloud backups, which may be the easiest route to the required data, depending on their security.” Similar to penetration testers, law enforcement or vendors, such as Cellebrite, leverage vulnerabilities to bypass encryption. Often referred to aszero days, these may be unknown to the general public or even the device manufacturer at the time. In some cases, older — but only partially resolved — vulnerabilities might still be open to exploitation. For example, atalk at the recent Chaos Computer Club conferenceshowed how bypassing BitLocker encryption on a fully up-to-date Windows 11 system using Secure Boot might be possible. The hack exploited a Windows vulnerability, bitpixie (CVE-2023-21563), combined with a downgrade attack. Exploiting the bitpixie vulnerability against Windows BitLocker involves forcing the machine to boot in recovery mode over a network connection, loading the volume mount key into memory. Another machine can then create a memory dump over the local area network, which contains the key, effectively bypassing BitLocker. The exploit opens the door to a full-scale compromise of a Windows system protected by BitLocker encryption, utilizing Secure Boot and TPM (Trusted Platform Module). Neither the researcher — Thomas Lambertz of Neodyme — nor Microsoft returned requests for comment from CSO; however, independent security experts told CSO that the attack vector was unlikely to be closed anytime soon. “This isn’t a new vulnerability, but its scope is limited to UEFI systems, meaning it leans in the favour of newer devices,” says Conor Agnew, head of compliance operations at penetration testing firm Closed Door Security. Agnew continued: “It was publicly announced in 2023 and supposedly patched. What’s most concerning is how there’s not the usual requirement of having possession of a device, stripping it to pieces, and brute forcing encryption keys.” “It’s a very quick attack — in relative terms of decryption attacks — and is likely not going to be resolved until 2026 when Microsoft rolls out the Secure Boot certificate updates,” Agnew says. Being able to entirely negate the on-disk encryption obviously poses a huge concern for anyone carrying data around on portable devices. “Getting a hold of something running BitLocker as the only form of encryption essentially becomes an open book,” Agnew says. “We don’t have to look too far back to see MOD [UK Ministry of Defence] devices left at bus stops.” Vendors such as Apple publicly state they do not create backdoors for law enforcement, but there’s a lot of speculation around this and many vendors have been caught with backdoors or security weaknesses in their systems. Law enforcement agencies have pressured companies to create “lawful access” solutions, particularly on smartphones, to take Apple as an example. “You also have the co-operation of cloud companies, which if backups are held can sidestep the need to break the encryption of a device all together,” Closed Door Security’s Agnew explains. The security community has long argued against law enforcement backdoors, not least because they create security weaknesses that criminal hackers might exploit. “Despite protests from law enforcement and national security organizations, creating a skeleton key to access encrypted data is never a sensible solution,” CreateFuture’s Watkins argues. “What good actors can access, bad actors eventually will, too. The same applies to hardware-level backdoors in devices like phones and laptops — often requested by law enforcement but a terrible idea for genuine security,” Watkins adds. Remote access to phones and computers can be achieved through remote hacking with the relevant sanctioned authorities. “This includes accessing data and listening to communications,” says CyXcel’s Farrell. “Alternatively, software or hardware can be introduced covertly to the physical devices and then monitored remotely.” Law enforcement agencies do need to identify the suspect’s number before gaining access remotely. This can be achieved by deploying equipment that replicates a cell site base station. “Deploying the equipment convinces the phones that it is the best connection and once connected, the IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) is then recorded,” Farrell explains. “Tactical use with the suspect under surveillance will identify the suspects phone number. This equipment is used globally by law enforcement.” Depending on the user’s location, anevil twin Wi-Fi networkin a public place could allow for decrypted access to network traffic without physically accessing the machine. Malware is likely the easiest way to achieve machine access, probably through a targeted attack, such as tricking a suspect into downloading malware or a USB key left on a desk with “free bitcoin” printed on it (or a similar enticing promise). “A similar alternative, which sounds like a ‘Mission Impossible’ plot but is in use today, is to exploit side channels, such as EM [electro-magnetic] interference or acoustic attacks, to retrieve a machine’s password,” CreateFuture’s Watkins says. “Wireless keyboards and other devices are often vulnerable and can be exploited without the user’s knowledge,” Watkins adds. Another possibility to expose a target’s encryption key or password relies on malware or hardware interference using something installed in the supply chain. EncroChat was a Europe-based encrypted communications network and service provider. It offered modified Android smartphones with enhanced security features, including encrypted communications and remote wiping. The service gained popularity among criminals following the closure of similar services, helping to boost its membership to around 60,000 subscribers by mid-2020. European law enforcement agencies successfully infiltrated the EncroChat network, deploying malware on a French server allowing them to access messages and disable the panic wipe feature.The police operation led to thousands of arrests. Jessica Sobey, barrister at Stokoe Partnership Solicitors, an experienced criminal defense lawyer, said the admissibility of evidence obtained through the Encrochat hack was fiercely contested in court. “The IPT [Investigatory Powers Tribunal] rejected the defense argument that the NCA withheld critical information when it applied for a warrant to obtain messages from the EncroChat network,” Sobey tells CSO. “It ruled that the use of a TEI warrant was justified, and that the investigation could be classified as a single investigation into the criminal use of EncroChat.” Sobey adds: “Defense lawyers, however, continue to argue that the IPT has blurred the distinction between bulk warrants and thematic warrants and this could still prove to be fertile ground for legal challenges.

Top 5 ways attackers use generative AI to exploit your systems,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3819176/top-5-ways-attackers-use-generative-ai-to-exploit-your-systems.html,"Cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting gen AI technologies to enhance the sophistication and efficiency of their attacks. Taking phishing to the next level Facilitating malware development Accelerating vulnerability hunting and exploits Escalating threats with alternative platforms Breaking in with authentication bypass Countermeasures Related content Generative AI red teaming: Tips and techniques for putting LLMs to the test Trump nominates cyber vet Sean Plankey for CISA chief amid DOGE cuts and firings The state of ransomware: Fragmented but still potent despite takedowns The risks of standing down:  Why halting US cyber ops against Russia erodes deterrence Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the technology industry and this is equally true for the cybercrime ecosystem, as cybercriminals are increasingly leveraging generative AI to improve their tactics, techniques, and procedures and deliver faster, stronger, and sneakier attacks. But as with legitimate use of emerging AI tools, abuse of generative AI for nefarious ends isn’t so much about the novel and unseen as it is about productivity and efficiency, lowering the barrier to entry, and offloading automatable tasks in favor of higher-order thinking on the part of the humans involved. “AI doesn’t necessarily result in new types of cybercrimes, and instead enables the means to accelerate or scale existing crimes we are familiar with, as well as introduce new threat vectors,” Dr. Peter Garraghan, CEO/CTO of AI security testing vendor Mindgard and a professor at the UK’s Lancaster University, tells CSO. Garraghan continues: “If a legitimate user can find utility in using AI to automate their tasks, capture complex patterns, lower the barrier of technical entry, reduced costs, and generate new content, why wouldn’t a criminal do the same?” Here is a look at various ways cybercriminals are putting gen AI to use in exploiting enterprise systems today. Gen AI enables thecreation of highly convincing phishing emails, greatly increasingly the likelihood of prospective marks giving over sensitive information to scam sites or downloading malware. Instead of sending a reasonably generic and unconvincing email, often with grammatical and formatting inconsistencies and errors, the use of AI enables cybercriminals to quickly generate more sophisticated and legitimate-looking emails, with the potential for greater personalization to target the recipient. Gen AI tools help criminals pull together different sources of data to enrich their campaigns — whether this is group social profiling, or targeted information gleaned from social media. “AI can be used to quickly learn what types of emails are being rejected or opened, and in turn modify its approach to increase phishing success rate,” Mindgard’s Garraghan explains. Asphishing attacks branch out in kind, AI-generatedaudio and video deepfakescan be used as part of more sophisticated social engineering attacks. In the most high-profile example to date, a finance worker at design and engineering company Arup wastricked into authorizing a fraudulent HK$200 million ($25.6 million) transactionafter attending a videoconference call during which fraudsters used deepfake technology to impersonate its UK-based chief finance officer. Artificial intelligence can also be used to generate more sophisticated or at least less labour-intensive malware. For example, cybercriminals are using gen AI to create malicious HTML documents. The XWorm attack, initiated by HTML smuggling, which contains malicious code that downloads and runs the malware, bears the hallmarks of development via AI. “The loader’s detailed line-by-line description suggesting it was crafted using generative AI,” according to the latest edition ofHP Wolf Security’s Threat Insights Report. In addition, the “design of the HTML webpage delivering XWorm is almost visually identical as the output from ChatGPT 4o after prompting the LLM to generate an HTML page that offers a file download,” HP Wolf Security adds. Similar techniques were in play with the earlier AsyncRAT campaign, according to HP’s enterprise security division. Elsewhere,ransomware group FunkSec— an Algeria-linked ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operator that takes advantage of double-extortion tactics — has begun harnessing AI technologies, according to Check Point Research. “FunkSec operators appear to use AI-assisted malware development, which can enable even inexperienced actors to quickly produce and refine advanced tools,”Check Point researchers wrote in a blog post. The traditionally difficult task of analyzing systems for vulnerabilities and developing exploits can be simplified through use of gen AI technologies. “Instead of a black hat hacker spending the time to probe and perform reconnaissance against a system perimeter, an AI agent can be tasked to do this automatically,” Mingard’s Garraghan says. Gen AI may be behind a 62% reduction in the time between a vulnerability being discovered and its exploitation by attackers from 47 days to just 18 days, according to arecent study by threat intelligence firm ReliaQuest. “This sharp decrease strongly indicates that a major technological advancement — likely GenAI — is enabling threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities at unprecedented speeds,” ReliaQuest writes. Adversaries are leveraging gen AI alongside pen-testing tools to write scripts for tasks such as network scanning, privilege escalation, and payload customization. AI is also likely being used by cybercriminals to analyze scan results and suggest optimal exploits, effectively allowing them to identify flaws in victim systems faster. “These advances accelerate many phases in the kill chain, particularly initial access,” ReliaQuest concludes. CSO’s Lucian Constantin offers a deeper look at howgenerative AI tools are transforming the cyber threat landscapeby democratizing vulnerability hunting for for pen-testers and attackers alike. Cybercriminals are rapidly shifting from ChatGPT to new AI models from China — DeepSeek and Qwen — to generate malicious content. “Threat actors are openly sharing techniques to jailbreak these models, bypass security controls, and create malware, info-stealers, and spam campaigns with minimal restrictions,” according to Check Point Research. “Some are even discussing how to use these AI tools to evade banking anti-fraud protections — a significant escalation in cyber threats.” “Multiple discussions and shared techniques on using DeepSeek to bypass banking system anti-fraud protections have been found, indicating the potential for significant financial theft,”Check Point warns in a technical blog post. China-based AI companyDeepSeek, whose recent entry hassent shockwaves through the industry, is weakly protected against abuse compared to its Western counterparts. Check Point Research explains: “While ChatGPT has invested substantially in anti-abuse provisions over the last two years, these newer models appear to offer little resistance to misuse, thereby attracting a surge of interest from different levels of attackers, especially the low skilled ones — individuals who exploit existing scripts or tools without a deep understanding of the underlying technology.” Cybercriminals have also begun developing their own large language models (LLMs) — such asWormGPT, FraudGPT, DarkBERT, and others — built without the guardrails that constrain criminals’ misuse of mainstream gen AI platforms. These platforms are commonly harnessed for applications such as phishing and malware generation. Moreover, mainstream LLMs can also be customized for targeted use. Security researcher Chris Kubeckarecently shared with CSOhow her custom version of ChatGPT, called Zero Day GPT, helped her identify more than 20 zero-days in a matter of months. Gen AI tools can also be abused to bypass security defences such as CAPTCHAs or biometric authentication. “AI can defeat CAPTCHA systems and analyze voice biometrics to compromise authentication,” according to cybersecurity vendor Dispersive. “This capability underscores the need for organizations to adopt more advanced, layered security measures.” Collectively the misuse of GenAI tools is making it easier for less skilled cybercriminals to earn a dishonest living. Defending against the attack vector challenges security professionals to harness the power of artificial intelligence more effectively than attackers. “Criminal misuse of AI technologies is driving the necessity to test, detect, and respond to these threats, in which AI is also being leveraged to combat cybercriminal activity,” Mindgard’s Garraghan says. In ablog post,Lawrence Pingree, VP of technical marketing at Dispersive, outlines preemptive cyber defenses that security professionals can take to win what he describes as an “AI ARMS (Automation, Reconnaissance, and Misinformation) race” between attackers and defenders. “Relying on traditional detection and response mechanisms is no longer sufficient,” Pingree warns. Alongside employee education and awareness programs, enterprises should be using AI to detect and neutralize generative AI-based threats in real-time. Randomization and preemptive changes to IP addresses, system configurations, and so on, can act as an obstacle to attack. Leveraging AI to simulate potential attack scenarios and predict adversary behavior through threat simulation and predictive intelligence also offers increased resilience against potential attacks.

8 biggest cybersecurity threats manufacturers face,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3618133/8-biggest-cybersecurity-threats-manufacturers-face.html,"The manufacturing sector remains a prominent target for cybercriminals, due to complex supply chains, legacy industry control and IoT systems, and a lack of appetite for downtime. 1. Ransomware attacks 2. Industrial control system attacks 3. Supply chain risks 4. IoT vulnerabilities 5. Phishing 6. Regulatory pressures 7. APT campaigns 8. DDoS attacks Related content Report on ransomware attacks on Fortinet firewalls also reveals possible defenses The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time The state of ransomware: Fragmented but still potent despite takedowns Ransomware goes postal: US healthcare firms receive fake extortion letters Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  The manufacturing sector’s rapid digital transformation, complex supply chains, and reliance on third-party vendors make for a challenging cyber threat environment for CISOs. Manufacturers — often prime targets for state-sponsored malicious actors and ransomware gangs — face the difficult task of maintaining cost-effective operations while modernizing their network infrastructure. “Many manufacturing systems rely on outdated technology that lacks modern security measures, creating exploitable vulnerabilities,” says Paul Cragg, CTO at managed security services firm NormCyber. “This is exacerbated by the integration of industrial internet of things [IIoT] devices, which expand the attack surface.” For example, many manufacturing organizations run outdated industrial control systems (ICS) that run antiquated software such as Embedded Windows XP, which no longer receives security patches. In addition, IoT, IIoT, operational technology (OT), and SCADA systems are often poorly supported by vendors because they are designed for operational capabilities rather than security. Lack of awareness from the business to understand what assets may be externally or internet facing is also an issue for organizations in this sector. Poor patching practices and misconfigurations are other sources of not infrequent problems for manufacturing CISOs. Syed M. Belal, global director of OT/ICS cybersecurity strategy and enablement for Hexagon’s Asset Lifecycle Intelligence division, tells CSO there were significant disparities in cybersecurity maturity across the sector. “While industries like chemicals and semiconductors exhibit relatively higher cybersecurity maturity, others, such as food and beverage or textiles, lag significantly,” Belal says. “Even within advanced sectors, inconsistencies persist across organizations.” Operational technology systems — which may include complex robotics and automation components — are typically replaced far more slowly than components of IT networks are, contributing to thegrowing security debtthat many manufacturers carry. “Legacy systems, designed before modern cybersecurity threats emerged, often lack basic protections like encryption or access controls,” Hexagon’s Belal explains. “These vulnerabilities complicate patch management and make such equipment prime targets for attackers.” Experts consulted by CSO highlighted several categories of threats faced by the industrial sector. Ransomwareremains one of the most severe threats facing the industrial sector today. Cybercriminals are employing advanced techniques such as double and triple extortion, in which organizations are threatened with the leak of portions of sensitive data. More than four in five (83%) manufacturing and utility firms were targeted by a ransomware attack in the past 12 months, according to astudy by tech vendor Semperis. The majority (77%) were targeted multiple times — some even four times or more. Semperis also reports that 26% of industrial sector ransomware targets had to take systems offline, leading to business disruptions, while 17% had to close the business temporarily. Moreover, 68% of victims paid a ransom, with two thirds of those having paid a ransom multiple times, according to Semperis’ study. Out of 62 ransomware groups tracked by Cyfirma Research,39 (63%) targeted the manufacturing sector. Ransomware groups such as BlackSuit, Meow, andPlayshowed a strong focus on the sector, according to Cyfirma, which adds that RansomHub is also active in targeting the sector. “Manufacturing is particularly hard-hit as attackers know any factory or plant can’t afford to be down for long, so they demand two to four times the ransom than they might from other targets,” says Julie Albright, COO at network discovery and asset inventory vendor runZero. Industrial control systems attacks are another growing concern, particularly given the integration of IT and OT networks. “These interconnected networks provide more entry points for cybercriminals and insider threats,” says Jonathan Wright, director of products and operations at communication services provider GCX. “Once a threat actor gains access to one device or network segment, they can exploit the connected system to escalate their attacks.” IT/OT convergence expands the attack surface, making ICS environments more vulnerable to nation-state actors and advanced persistent threats. “Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in PLCs, SCADA systems, and HMIs [human-machine interfaces], potentially causing severe disruptions to critical infrastructure and endangering public safety,” says Aron Brand, CTO of distributed cloud file storage firm Ctera. “Zero-trust architecture and robust network segmentation have become essential for limiting lateral movement within these environments, while AI-powered threat detection can help quickly identify and respond to malicious activities.” Another industrial environment cyber risk comes from third-party service and support partners visiting industrial sites with their own laptops and removable media to update firmware on the ICS they manage. “Malware hosted on media like USB drives can bypass traditional network-based security measures and move between IT and OT systems laterally,” notes James Neilson, SVP international at cybersecurity vendor OPSWAT. “Such environments were not designed to detect IT malware, leaving them highly vulnerable when compromised via removable media.” Manufacturing supply chains are highly interconnected, with multiple suppliers and third-party vendors contributing to production processes. “Attackers are increasingly exploiting these relationships to launch supply chain attacks, targeting weak links to infiltrate OT systems,” Carlos Buenano, CTO for OT at Armis, tells CSO. “Once inside, they can cause production delays, manipulate product quality, or steal intellectual property.” Problems can arise due to a range of issues, includingsecurity vulnerabilities in critical software platforms, compromise from vendor support connections, or vendor software or hardware components compromised via an upstream attack. Between August and November 2024 alone,174 high-scoring vulnerabilities related to manufacturing were identified, with four having known exploits requiring immediate attention, according to Cyfirma. Protecting against supply chain attacks requires not only securing one’s own systems but alsoensuring the security of all partnerswithin the supply chain. “This might involve conducting vendor risk assessments and implementing strong contractual requirements for cybersecurity,” Armis’ Buenano says. The software supply chain, with a heavy reliance on open-source code, also creates a potential security headache for industrial sector organizations. “According to the 2024 Open Source Security and Risk Analysis report, 88% of all source code within manufacturing and robotic industry is open source code,” says Aditi Gupta, principal security consultant at Black Duck. “With the heavy reliance on OSS, comes the issues associated with license cost, operational risks, and security vulnerabilities.” Indirect risks, such as attacks on suppliers or logistical hubs, can also disrupt manufacturing operations. For instance, Japanese car maker Toyotasuspended production at 14 assembly plantsin February 2022 following a suspected cyberattack on its supplier, Kojima Industries. The proliferation of IoT devices in industrial settings has dramatically expanded manufacturers’ attack surfaces. These devices, often deployed without robust security measures, can serve as entry points for cybercriminals to access core OT systems. For example, compromised IoT sensors, such as smart meters in a power grid could disrupt monitoring and control functions, leading to major power outages. “As more businesses embrace smart technologies in manufacturing, new entry points for cybercriminals are opening up,” says Steve Knibbs, director of Vodafone Business Security Enhanced. “IoT devices, often shipped with default usernames and passwords or lacking strong encryption, can be exploited to access sensitive data, disrupt operations, or even tamper with production processes.” Manufacturers must regularly update software to fix vulnerabilities, apply strict access controls, and ensure that strong, unique passwords and multifactor authentication is used across environments. Companies should also look to segment networks to keep IoT devices separate from critical systems while rolling out real-time monitoring to pick up any threats. Phishing attackson the manufacturing industry rose more than 80% between September 2023 and September 2024, according to astudy by Abnormal Security. Business email compromise attacks targeting manufacturers have increased 56% year over year. Between September 2023 and September 2024, the number of vendor email compromise (VEC) attacks on manufacturers increased by 24%, Abnormal Security reports. Still, phishing is a cross-industry problem and other reports and experts we spoke to suggest manufacturing is less exposed than most. “The sector shows limited appeal for broad phishing campaigns due to low monetizable value, limited high-value data, and minimal PII repositories,” Cyfirma reports. Manufacturing subsectors such as automotive and electronics are increasingly reliant on automation and digitalization, and are facing more stringent cybersecurity regulation in the EU. “Regulatory frameworks, such as theEU’s NIS2 directive, now designate certain manufacturing domains — computers, electronics, machinery, motor vehicles, and transportation — as critical sectors, subject to enhanced cybersecurity requirements,” Hexagon’s Belal explains. Over the past year, nine out of 13 (69%) of APT campaigns obersved by Cyfirma targeted the manufacturing sector, peaking in September with sustained activity since, the company reports. Key threat actors running these attacks include Chinese groups, Russian groups (FIN7, Gamaredon), Pakistani APT36, Iranian Fox Kitten, and the North Korean Lazarus Group. Attacks impacted 15 countries with significant manufacturing economies, including the US, UK, Japan, Taiwan, and India, with increased activity in Vietnam. Netscout’s1H24 DDoS Threat Intelligencereport revealed that the manufacturing industry — and related sectors such as construction — are among the main targets forDDoS attackstoday. “As it continues to embrace digital technologies and extend its digital footprint, the manufacturing sector is becoming increasingly vulnerable to DDoS attacks,” says Richard Hummel, threat intelligence lead for Netscout. “Its vital contribution to the economy, along with its minimal tolerance for downtime and intricate digital landscapes, makes manufacturing — and related sectors — such an alluring target for threat actors.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS Report on ransomware attacks on Fortinet firewalls also reveals possible defenses The most notorious and damaging

Top tips for CISOs running red teams,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3618336/top-tips-for-cisos-running-red-teams.html,"Learning that your systems aren’t as secured as expected can be challenging for CISOs and their teams. Here are a few tips that will help change that experience. Be generous with scope Embrace creativity Assume breach Keep egos out Foster collaboration Related content CIOs and CISOs take on NIS2: Key challenges, security opportunities Generative AI red teaming: Tips and techniques for putting LLMs to the test Trump nominates cyber vet Sean Plankey for CISA chief amid DOGE cuts and firings The state of ransomware: Fragmented but still potent despite takedowns Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Red team is the de facto standard in offensive security testing when you want to know how all security investments — from technological controls to user training to response procedures — work together when subjected to a targeted attack. Unlikepenetration testing, which aims to comprehensively assess a system, orpurple team, which assesses detection and response capabilities, the purpose of a red team is to find attack paths from an initial beachhead to your crown jewels. Though red team exercises have matured greatly over the past decade, many executives have a hard time extracting as much value out of the red team as they’d like. Here are some of the guiding principles I advise security leaders to follow through the process, from planning to remediation, to get the most out of their red team engagements. The number one thing that I see go wrong with red teams is an overly restrictive scope. This problem emerges during the planning phase when the person in charge of defining which systems, users, and networks are out of scope ends up restricting the attack path the red team can use. This leads to an unrealistic engagement, skewed results, and an underleveraged team. While there are many reasons why this happens, there tend to be two primary ones: distrust in the red team or fear. Both lead to the desire to control the situation, which usually manifests itself as reducing scope to exclude all things that could potentially be viewed as risky. Instead, leaders should default to a completely open scope and remove only the systems that would cause significant harm to the organization in the unlikely event that they were to go offline because of testing. Things like manufacturing systems, systems related to SWIFT for financial institutions, or high-frequency trading infrastructure all fall into this category. To allow for restrictive systems to be removed from scope without artificially hindering the engagement, one of the things that I’ve seen work extremely well is using checkpoints that prove that the red teamcouldaccess the sensitive systems without requiring them to directly touch them. An example of this would be if the red team could compromise a user account that can authenticate to the sensitive system and prove that the credentials were valid. Remember, adversaries don’t care about your scope. This one may be a bit controversial, but if you are constraining your red team to rigidly emulate a specific threat actor or campaign, you are almost certainly not getting the most value out of your engagements. On paper, adversary emulation (i.e., making your engagement reflect the TTPs leveraged by a threat actor of concern) makes a ton of sense as you’re focusing your efforts on what you know has been observed in the wild. There are many logical flaws inherent to this approach, ranging from issues with the known-known nature of threat reporting to faulty assumption that adversaries can’t vary their tradecraft. I’d argue that situations where you want to replay a threat actor’s specific behavior are better suited by using aBAS tool. Ultimately, this has the same net effect as the problem described in the previous section, but this time restricting the techniques which can be used rather than what can be targeted. This ends up stifling your team’s creativity, leading to a less effective engagement that results in poorer understanding of your security posture than you otherwise would have been able to gain. When you impose artificial restrictions on the team, you prevent them from coming up with novel ways of chaining techniques together with their understanding of the environment and business and remove their ability to capitalize on new opportunities that may emerge during an engagement. If threat-centric testing is a focus of your security program, try either using other projects to emulate the specific behaviors of a threat (such as a purple team that focuses their testing on just the relevant techniques in the threat report) or by using the threat report to guide the planning of the red team engagement rather than constraining them to only what was described. One example of how the latter might be done would be to use only the macro points from the threat report. For instance, a reasonable engagement could be planned using a threat report that describes some relevant threat actor who compromised Windows workstations belonging to users in the financial department, established persistence, and then began searching for sensitive file shares and exfiltrating data to an AWS instance. This doesn’t constrain the team to what specific persistence mechanism they have to use, or which type of file share they must target, leaving them space to be creative but still tying the overall theme to a threat that you may be asked about by the board or your boss. One of the biggest structural failures I saw during my time in red teams was when customers required the team to gain their own initial access as a requirement to begin assessing the internal network. This was incredibly frustrating to see, not because it was particularly difficult, but because it just isn’t a good use of anyone’s time. You must decide if you would rather spend five weeks of your six-week engagement having the team phish your users or exploring attack paths to help determine risk and close holes. I firmly believe that red teams are best suited to answer the question of what happensafteran adversary has breached the perimeter. This doesn’t mean that they are incapable of performing an initial access assessment, but rather that they’re better suited for a different task. Assessing the perimeter is virtually always better run as a separate project due to the time and resources required to effectively measure susceptibility. A smart way I’ve seen CISOs structure their red teams where they need to assess initial access vectors is to cede access to a system so that a portion of the team can begin the path finding portion of the engagement while another contingent can perform the initial access component, rejoining the group when/if they complete that stage. I’ve seen more mature organizations break these engagements out into entirely separate projects, sometimes chaining them together to tell a story. One of my favorite examples of this was a financial organization that ran two initial access projects — phishing and external attack surface exploitation — concurrently for eight weeks. The results from these engagements, which included the users who detonated the phishing payload and the external systems on which the team had gotten code execution, became the beachheads onto which access for the red team was ceded. The debrief at completion of a red team engagement can often be very tense. The red team has likely revealed serious failures along their attack path and you have all responsible parties sitting around a table, or on a call hearing about them, often for the first time. Why didn’t your SOC detect their lateral movement? Why did your identity team turn MFA off for your enterprise admins? Why did your security engineering team fail to deploy your EDR onto all hosts in the environment? It becomes all too easy to begin pointing fingers and assigning blame, leaving everyone upset, flustered, and embarrassed. Remember, however, that a friendly team just found serious flaws before an adversary did and you get the opportunity to fix it. Focus on creating an environment of honesty, humility and empathy. This isn’t to say that people won’t still feel negative emotions, but the tone of the conversation from the outset will significantly improve the quality of the discussion. Your job as a security leader is to make sure that the discussion is focused on the problems identified, not the individuals involved. If the conversation does start to become defensive or argumentative, take a moment to remind the group that you’re attacking the problem together as a team and that the red team has found the issues before something bad actually happened. Eventually, this will become ingrained in your culture and others in the group will start passing this approach down, allowing it to permeate your organization. When a red team is isolated, they often become viewed as outsiders that only bring bad news and end up being treated as adversaries rather than partners. This is why it is paramount that your red team spend a sizable portion of their time working with other teams in the security organization and across the business. Successful red teams have great relationships with their stakeholders, including those who own the systems that the red team targets in their operations. The most valuable engagements that I ever worked on were ones where I got to sit with the SOC after the engagement and help them build detections for the techniques that we used. The relationships and goodwill built during the remediation process saved us during dicey situations and made us more empathetic to the team’s workload. Red teams should be missionaries, not mercenaries, within the security organization. If your red team isn’t working directly with their engagement stakeholders already, start there. Encourage red teamers to form personal relationships with the SOC. Take them out to lunch or spend a week together every quarter working on a project, or even stand up a rotation program where the teams swap representatives for a few weeks to help foster empathy and keep things fresh.

Key strategies to enhance cyber resilience,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3618501/key-strategies-to-enhance-cyber-resilience.html,"To avoid costly downtime and brand reputational damage security experts offer four key measures to ensure the minimal amount of downtime possible during an unplanned event. Prioritize cross-functional collaboration Stakeholder-specific cyber resilience playbooks Focus on what happens after risk mitigation Know how to pitch the ROI of cyber resilience Related content The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time CIOs and CISOs take on NIS2: Key challenges, security opportunities Aptori Now on Google Cloud Marketplace for AI-Powered Security and Automated Risk Remediation Suite 404: Training executives for cyberattack response in a playful way Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Thefaulty CrowdStrike software updatethat triggered IT outages on a global scale in July was a sobering reminder of the importance of incident response andbusiness continuity plans. Theupdate caused more than eight million Windows devices to crashand take down with them airline reservation systems, hospital and government services, financial and banking applications and myriad other systems across industry sectors. It called attention, in near unprecedented manner, to the lack of cyber resilience even among some of the largest organizations in the world. As worried members of the US Congress wrote in aletter to CrowdStrike, the incident served “as a broader warning about the national security risks associated with network dependency.” The UK financial services regulator Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found that organizations which had invested in operational resilience were less impacted than others. “Firms that had mapped their important business services, and the resources necessary to deliver these services, were able to prioritize getting key services back online to reduce the overall impact the incident had on their operations,” theFCA wrotein an October post-mortem of the incident. “Firms benefitted from having tested scenarios that were severe but plausible, including those impacting multiple important business services at the same time.” Here, according to several security experts, are four measures that will help prevent organizations from a similar disaster as the one from July. Cross-functional collaboration is critical tocyber resiliencebecause it ensures that teams across IT, security, operations, and business units work together to identify,mitigate, and respond to threats effectively. Such collaboration enables incident responders to leverage different expertise and skills sets, improve communication and align strategies. “Operational resilience is a team sport and cyber resilience is no different,” says Christy Wyatt, CEO of Absolute Security. “Discussing cyber-risk as an organization and fostering partnerships across teams to create a community focused on business continuity and compliance is your first step,” she says. Organizations should establish a cyber resilience steering committee to provide a foundation for joint efforts, recommends James McQuiggan, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4. Ensure the steering committee includes representatives from all stakeholder groups including cybersecurity, business continuity, crisis management, and legal teams. “Establishing regular or monthly meetings can bring together the security features of disaster recovery/business continuity, crisis management, leadership, and legal teams to discuss objectives and emerging risks,” McQuiggan says. Using these meetings to share metrics around desired response times, recovery speed, and critical asset protection can further align different teams towards common resilience objectives. Cyber security playbooks offer step-by-step guidance on actions for responding to different cyber incidents such as ransomware attacks, data breaches, insider threats and phishing campaigns. They can help standardize response efforts and minimize confusion and duplicative effort during a crisis. To bolster resilience consider developing stakeholder specific playbooks, Wyatt says. Different teams play different roles in incident response from detecting risk, deploying key controls, maintaining compliance, recovery and business continuity. Expect that each stakeholder group will have their own requirements and set of KPIs to meet, she says. “For example, the security team may have different concerns than the IT operations team. As a result, organizations should draft cyber resilience playbooks for each set of stakeholders that provide very specific guidance and ROI benefits for each group.” Stakeholders should practice these paybooks as part of their tabletop exercises, Wyatt advises. Establish clear accountability at every organizational role and make sure everyone is clear about their role in maintaining resilience. Cyber resilience is as much about the ability to recover from a major security incident as it is aboutproactively preparing, preventing, detecting and remediatingit. That means having a formaldisaster recovery plan, doing regular offsite back-ups of all critical systems and testing both the plan and the recovery process on a frequent basis. “Integrate cyber resilience into business continuity planning and ensure alignment with overall business objectives,” says Luigi Lenguito, CEO of BforeAI. “Make sure to have the people involved in plans, practice the execution. Not exercising is like exercising for failure.” From a technology standpoint, implementing a resilience capability requires investments in backup and recovery systems or services, redundant systems, fault-tolerant infrastructure and reliable failover mechanisms. It also involves training staff on proper recovery procedures and roles and ensuring that vendors you rely on have robust recovery plans of their own. “Cyber resilience is about the ability to resurrect from an attack, ideally with continuity,”Lenguito says. Make sure to consider your hybrid workforce when developing processes to minimize downtime and ensure quick recovery, Wyatt from Absolute Security says. Take your table-top exercises all the way to the end by incorporating remote recovery capabilities. Your ability to operate and avoid reputational harm depends on getting remote workers back online safely. Also make sure your vendors and others in the supply chain are doing their part. “Select, deploy, and test applications that can demonstrate their ability to remain always on and operational,” she says. “Rigorous compliance checks and resilience measures must be integrated into vendor management processes. McQuiggan stresses the importance of testing. Develop and test business continuity plans regularly along with backup testing quarterly to ensure the backups are available to use in the event of a failure, he says. Boards have become very focused on managing risk and have become increasingly fluent in cyber risk. But many boards are surprised that when a crisis occurs, broader operational resilience is not a point of these discussions, according to Wyatt. Bring your board along by having external experts walk through previous events and break down the various areas of impact. “For example, a recent survey showed that only one in 11 companies paid the ransom but even for those that did, the ransom itself was less than32% of the total cost of the event,” she says. Not being able to operate internal systems, take orders, or connect with customers can have a longstanding reputational and financial impact on a company. “How you recover from an event has almost more impact on the overall cost than from the attack itself,” Wyatt notes. Jeff Williams, CTO at Contrast Security, believes that security leaders may be making a mistake in pitching the ROI from cyber resilience investments in terms of financial impact alone. Often, security leaders try to estimate the costs of avoided breaches to demonstrate value in security investments. But the numbers they estimate can be so astronomical that it causes eyes to glaze over. Business leaders and boards simply tend to tune out those numbers, Williams says. “Business leaders are much more responsive to legal requirements such as the new EU Product Liability Directive that creates no-fault liability for software defects, including security vulnerabilities, and cost-savings,” he says. “So, I recommend focusing on metrics like accelerating software development and improved innovation.” Use both data and stories where possible. “Too many leaders rely on dry and abstract charts about policy, vulnerability rates, mean time to recover, downtime, etc.,” Williams says. “The data is important, but don’t forget the stories that make the data real and compelling. Use those stories to build support for the initiatives you are pursuing.” Stress the importance of maintaining customer trust, Lenguito from BforeAI says. Point out the need for compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. And do not forget to highlight the potential brand impact and reputation cost of downtime related to a cyberattack. “No cyber insurance will help recover the lost value from your brand,” he says.

7 biggest cybersecurity stories of 2024,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3629818/7-biggest-cybersecurity-stories-of-2024.html,"CrowdStrike, Change Healthcare, rising ransomware threats and cyber regulations — here’s what dominated the headlines this year and how CISOs and cyber pros are adapting. Change Healthcare ransomware attack CrowdStrike meltdown Widespread Snowflake breaches linked to MFA shortcomings LockBit takedown fails to curtail ransomware threats Deepfakes become a bigger threat NPD breach fallout Regulatory pressures on the rise Related content CIOs and CISOs take on NIS2: Key challenges, security opportunities Australian financial firm hit with lawsuit after massive data breach CIOs and CISOs grapple with DORA: Key challenges, compliance complexities 21% of CISOs pressured to not report compliance issues Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Cybersecurity headlines were plenty this year, with several breaches, attacks, and mishaps drawing worldwide attention. But a few incidents in particular had far-reaching consequences, with the potential to reshape industry protections, shake up how vendors secure customers’ systems, or drive security leaders to reassess their strategies. Longer-term trends such as increased cybersecurity regulations and the impact of AI on the industry also had and will have a significant impact on IT security operations in 2024 and beyond. Here is a look at the cybersecurity stories of the year, along with perspective on how these happenings are reshaping CISOs’ strategies and tactics in defending the enterprise. A ransomware attack on UnitedHealth Group–owned Change Healthcare caused widespread disruption in February. Cybercriminals affiliated to the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware gangbroke into Change Healthcare’s systemsusing leaked credentials to access a Citrix portal account unprotected by multifactor authentication access controls. They siphoned off sensitive data — names, Social Security numbers, diagnoses, treatment plans, and financial data, laterestimated to affect up to 112 million people— before deploying ransomware. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) isinvestigating whether a breach of protected health information occurredin assessing whether either UHG or Change Healthcare violated strict healthcare sector privacy regulations. Change Healthcare — which operates the US’s biggest clearinghouse for medical insurance claims — took its systems offline in response to the attack, which paralyzed large parts of the US healthcare system for weeks. Thousands of pharmacies and healthcare providers experienced disruption because electronic payments and medical claims could not be processed. Patients were forced to pay for many of their medications out of pocket instead of relying on copays or coupons. The breach threatened many medical providers with insolvency.  UnitedHealth Group offered $2 billion in assistance to healthcare providers affected by the attack. The combined costs of accelerated payments and no-interest, no-fee loans to thousands of affected providers, as well as incident response efforts and a complete rebuild of Change Healthcare’s systems alongside revenue losses mean the total cost of the breach is expected to exceed $1 billion. It later emerged that Change Healthcare paid the equivalent of $22 million in Bitcoin to a cryptocurrency wallet associated with ALPHV in the wake of the attack. That didn’t stop the RansomHub group from attempting to extort UnitedHealth over the release of sensitive information stolen during the breach. The attack provoked calls tomandate baseline security standards for healthcare providersduring Congressional hearings in April. Questions were also raised about how consolidation is making the healthcare sector more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Overall, the incident brought worldwide attention to the increasingcyber assault on the healthcare industry, withransomware viewed as the sector’s central threat. CISOs in healthcare and other industries have been left withseveral critical lessonsin the wake of the fiasco. A faulty configuration update to CrowdStrike’s Falcon Sensor security software causedsystem crashes to Windows systemsrunning the software in July. Thecontent update to Channel File 291caused an out-of-bounds memory read in the Windows sensor client, crashing affected Windows PCs and servers and sent them into a bootloop. An estimated 8.5 million Microsoft Windows systems were affected. Even though the faulty update was quickly withdrawn, theresulting outageaffected organizations worldwide across multiple sectors, including airlines, banks, broadcasters, and hospitals. In the wake of the outage, CrowdStrikestrengthened its pre-release testing processesand improved quality control. The incident highlighted the critical importance of robust testing and failsafe mechanisms for security software. In response to the outage, Microsoft began a process ofevaluating whether security vendors needed kernel-levelaccess to work effectively. By running in the kernel security software packages gain greater visability and the opportunity to thwart low-level malware but the approach means that if there’s a problem the whole systems will crash into the infamous blue screen of death. In addition to bringing worldwide attention to kernel-level and software testing issues, the incident highlighted for CISOs and CIOsIT’s overdependence on administrative software, theneed to reassess cloud concentration risk, and theimportance of having a robust business continuity plan, among otherkey strategic issues. Account hacks involving cloud-based data warehousing firm Snowflakeled to multiple high-profile data breaches, affecting organizations, including AT&T, Ticketmaster, Neiman Marcus Group, and Advance Auto Parts. Cybercrime group UNC5537 systematically compromised Snowflake customer instances using stolen customer credentials before exfiltrating sensitive data. This compromised data was used in attempts to extort money from many of its victims or offered for sale through cybercrime forums, according to aninvestigationby Mandiant, the threat intel division of Google. In aregulatory filling, AT&Tadmittedin July that cybercriminals had stolen the phone and text message metadata of 110 million people. The compromised information included records of calls or texts but not the contents of any text messages or customer’s personally identifiable information. The US telcoreportedlypaid criminals $377,000 to throw away these stolen phone records. The issue was first uncovered in April after Mandiant tracked a data breach back to a Snowflake instance compromised using credentials previously stolen through infostealer malware. Subsequent work revealed this pattern repeated in multiple cases, many of which could be traced back to historic malware infections dating back to 2020. Mandiant and Google notified 165 potentially affected organizations. Compromised credentials of Snowflake customer accounts in instances where multifactor authentication was not enabled rather than any breach of Snowflake’s environment was blamed for the hacking spree. In response, Snowflake offered customersdetection and hardening guidance. Two suspects — Connor Riley Moucka from Kitchener, Ontario, and John Binns, an American man based in Turkey — wereindictedby US prosecutors in October over their alleged involvement in the Snowflake data breaches. The widespread attacks underscored whycloud securityhas become a top CISO priority and highlighted that, in today’s enterprise,MFA use is significantly behind where it should be, with new MFA mandates from vendors such asMicrosoftandAWSnow in the offing. In other cybercrime-related news, the LockBit ransomware gang was disrupted in a major international police operation in February. Servers and web domains linked to the gang were seized, rogue account were closed, and suspects arrested in Poland and Ukraine as part ofOperation Cronos. Despite the takedown, attacks with LockBit ransomware or variants thereof were later reported, and reports thatelements of the group intended to revive their operationsbegan to surface as well. As before, these scams typically involve attempts to extort victims over the threatened release of stolen data alongside demanding payments for decryption keys. LockBit — a major ransomware-as-a-service operation —made an estimated $90 million from attacking US victimsalone between January 2020 and June 2023. Once again, despite significant activity from policing authorities, ransomware continues to getfaster, smarter, and meaner, withnew groups continuing to emergein the wake of takedowns and enterprises left toadd new chaptersto their ransomware negotiation playbooks anddebate whether to pay the extortion price. The year saw accelerating use of artificial intelligence for bothbeneficialand malicious purposes. Attackers can use AI to scale and refine their techniques, making ransomware and phishing attacks more effective. For example, AI technologies can be abused to generate fake audio and video, so-calleddeepfakes. London-based multinational design and engineering companyArup fell victim to a deepfake scamthat cost it HK$200 million ($25.6 million). A finance worker at its Hong Kong office was tricked into authorizing the transaction after attending a videoconference call during which fraudsters used deepfake technology to impersonate its UK-based chief financial officer. Deepfakes are also starting to feature as an element inNorth Korean fake IT worker scams. North Korean operatives posing as legitimate IT professionals in attempts to gain employment at Western firms. If hired, these “remote workers” exploit their insider access to steal sensitive or proprietary information while collecting a salary that is funnelled back to the North Korean regime. More than 300 businesses are believed to have fallen victim to the fake worker IT scam that is estimated to have generated millions in revenue for the North Korean government, allowing it to evade international sanction while funding its weapons programs. Abreach of US background checking firm National Public Dataexposed the data of hundreds of millions of people in exposing 2.9 billion records. The hack took place in December 2023 but only became general knowledge after a 4TB dump of stolen data onto a cybercrime forum July 2024. The breach exposed the Social Security numbers, names, mailing addresses, emails, and phone numbers of an estimated 170 million people, in the US, UK, and Canada. In October 2024, National Public Data, which faced several lawsuits in the wake of the breach, filed for bankruptcy. TheSalt Typhoon cyber-espionage attacks on telecom providers, blamed on China, promptedplans to oblige telecom carriers to tighten up their security. Tougher cybersecurity regulations were also on the menu in Europe with the expansion of the EU’s Network and Information Security directive.NIS2 covers more industries and sectors, introducing stronger cybersecurity risk management measures and incident reporting. Revised breach disclosure rules from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have placed increased responsibility on the CISOs, particularly those in publicly traded firms. Security leaders are exposed topersonal liability for either cybersecurity failures or misleading disclosures. Increasingregulatory complexityand personal liability are just a few of the factors creating achallenging balancing act for CISOs— andcontributing to rising CISO job dissatisfactionandthoughts of defection— as they reflect on theirkey takeaways from 2024with an eye toward the new year.

The announcement that the group known as Salt Typhoon had compromised networks of major global telecommunications providers to conduct a broad and significant cyber espionage campaign showcased a certain disconnect regarding such electronic communications: As with email, we should never have considered them secure in the first place. Details were recentlyreleased in a white paperjointly authored by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), the Canadian Cyber Security Centre (CCCS), and New Zealand’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ). For many years, our telecommunications infrastructure was built with technology that required specialized knowledge or unique tools to trace communications. I am reminded of the classic tale of computer intrusion, that of Clifford Stoll and the story of “The Cuckoo’s Egg,” in which Stoll created a honeypot of fictitious information to keep an intruder online long enough for German authorities to trace the connection. Now, our communication infrastructure is integrated into internet technology and thus susceptible to being infiltrated through any number of possible intrusion points. Whilerecent guidance provided by CISA and the NSAspecifically concerns telecommunications infrastructure, because we use the internet for nearly everything these days, it’s wise to consider hardening your network with the same zeal for protection and hardening. I recommend reviewing the document and applying its general risk-reducing guidelines for traditional communication to all of your technology and across your entire network. Any change management to edge devices or communication hardware should be monitored and approved. Ensure that any firewall rules are approved and documented. And look beyond on-premise hardware to address any similar cloud networking changes. For example, when using Microsoft Entra, monitor the settings surrounding trusted networks and conditional access rules. Ensure that none of these settings are changed unless documented by members of your firm. Review ingress and egress to your network assets and determine whether you have access to the necessary logging to document access. Once again, don’t just look at access to your physical network, look at your cloud resources as well and ensure you have logging in place. In the case of cloud assets, this may mean you need to ensure you have the proper licensing in place to have the necessary logging. Ensure you have a “need-to-access” rule that only those administrators and workstations specified as administrative have access to sensitive devices and network locations. Set up egress filtering and access control lists to limit access to IP addresses, workstations, or network segments as you see fit. Invest in workstations that can receive restrictive policies such that they can be designated limited-access machines and trusted to remotely access sensitive devices on the edges of your network. Review all edge devices and ensure that they are up to date with firmware updates and patching — we often don’t have these devices under managed control and may not maintain their patching status. We should. Over the past year,ransomwarehas entered many a business from access points such as virtual private network (VPN) infrastructure, making it vital that that all assets connected to and using VPN are patched and installed on supported products. Ensure that modern cryptographic algorithms are in use and review their vendors for any past zero-day vulnerabilities and how long it took to patch them. You may want to place a priority on reviewing your edge access and how much it puts you at risk to give you the proper analysis of your risk from attack. Even if you don’t immediately patch for vulnerabilities, your endpoint detection often gives you enough protection to prevent operating system attacks. However, edge devices are frequently the first things targeted as attackers know that we often take much longer to patch access software due to the need to keep access required for day-to-day business purposes. It’s important to monitor your hardware and edge devices for any out-of-date or end-of-life announcements. We tend to pay attention to operating system end-of-life announcements due to the headlines and coverage provided by the vendors — for example, many of us are focused on the upcoming end-of-life of Windows 10 and the resulting extended security support software that Microsoft plans to sell next year. Don’t let the energy you put into that distract you from the other devices and apps that need maintenance. Review your access technology and ensure that phishing-resistant multifactor authentication is used in your environment. In business settings, ensure you use hardware-based multifactor authentication, such as PKI or FIDO. Attackers have used and targeted Cisco hardware and software in exploits in several attacks. Specifically, CISA recommends that you disable all services and technologies you are not explicitly using in your environment. In addition, it’s recommended to take additional actions to disable various Cisco services, such as the following: Disable Cisco’s Smart Install service. Disable guest shell access. Disable all non-encrypted web management capabilities. Ensure that web servers, if used, are set up with encrypted SSL connections. Only enable web management if required. Disable telnet and ensure it’s not enabled on any Virtual Teletype (VTY) lines. This is not the first, nor will it be the last, warning about threat groups supported by the People’s Republic of China targeting government and businesses. In February 2024, CISA released its advisory onVolt Typhoonand the APT’s ability to target and perform pre-compromise reconnaissance. As we close out the 2024 security year, I recommend you review its compromise discussion and your current infrastructure. Are you prepared to protect and defend yourself from such targeted attacks? Are you prepared to immediately patch for any edge device zero-day that may arise in 2025?

Hit with a $ 1.3 billion fine for unlawfully transferring personal data from the European Union to the US, Meta tops the list of recent big-ticket sanctions, with one other ten figure fine being levied against the Chinese firm Didi Global for violating that nation’s data protection laws. The third largest penalty was the $877 million fine against Amazon in 2021 for running afoul of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. Here are the biggest fines and penalties assessed for data breaches or non-compliance with security and privacy laws. In May 2023, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) concluded an enquiry into Meta Platform Ireland Limited (“Meta Ireland”) it had initiated in Aug 2020, billing the social media giant €1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) for violation of the GDPR. With regards to the article 46(1) of the GDPR, the Irish privacy watchdog blamed Meta Ireland for the transfer of personal data from the EU or the European Economic Area (EEA) to the US without adequate data privacy safeguards in connection with the delivery of its Facebook services. Meta’s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said, “We intend to appeal both the decision’s substance and its orders including the fine, and will seek a stay through the courts to pause the implementation deadlines.” Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Global was fined 8.026 billion yuan ($1.19 billion) by the Cyberspace Administration of China after it decided that the company violated the nations’ network security law, data security law, and personal information protection law. In a statement, Didi Global said it accepted the cybersecurity regulators’ decision, which came after ayear-long investigationinto the firm over its security practices and “suspected illegal activities.” In summer 2021, retail giant Amazon’s financial records revealed that officials in Luxembourg issued a €746 million (then $877 million) fine for breaches of the GDPR. Amazon was expected to be appeal the fine, with a spokesperson stating, “There has been no data breach, and no customer data has been exposed to any third party.” La Quadrature du Net, the French digital rights organization that filed the original data protection complaint against Amazon on behalf of 10,065 individual complainants in May 2018, said that was unsurprising, since its 19-page complaint targeted Amazon’s operation of a behavioral advertising system without adequate consent, and not an intermittent leak of personal data. 2017 saw Equifax lose the personal and financial information of nearly 150 million people due to an unpatched Apache Struts framework in one of its databases. The company had failed to fix a critical vulnerability months after a patch had been issued and then failed to inform the public of the breach for weeks after it been discovered. In July 2019 the credit agencyagreed to pay$575 million — potentially rising to $700 million — in a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and all 50 U.S. states and territories over the company’s “failure to take reasonable steps to secure its network.” $300 million of that will go to a fund providing affected consumers with credit monitoring services (another $125 million will be added if the initial payment is not enough to compensate consumers), $175 million will go to 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and $100 million will go to the CFPB. The settlement also requires the company to obtain third-party assessments of its information security program every two years. “Companies that profit from personal information have an extra responsibility to protect and secure that data,” said FTC Chairman Joe Simons. “Equifax failed to take basic steps that may have prevented the breach that affected approximately 147 million consumers.” Equifax had already been fined £500,000 [~$625,000]  in the UK for the 2017 breach, which was the maximum fine allowed under the pre-GDPR Data Protection Act 1998. In 2020, Equifax was made to pay further settlements relating to the breach:$7.75 million(plus $2 million in legal fees) to financial institutions in the US plus$18.2 millionand$19.5 millionto the states of Massachusetts and Indiana respectively. Concluding two enquiries made into Meta’s data processing operations in the European regions, commencing on the day GDPR came into operations (25 May, 2018), the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) announced in January 2023 that it found Meta platforms in breach of the GDPR “in connection with the delivery of its Facebook and Instagram services”. Meta Ireland was fined €210 million ($ 225 million) , for Facebook violations, and and €180 million ($ 193 million) for Instagram violations. Meta’s data processing operations with regards to Facebook and Instagram services were found in violations of several articles of the GDPR, including 5 (1) a) , 6 (1), 12 , and 13 (1) c), relating to the breach of transparency and information obligations. In September 2022, Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) fined Instagram for violating children’s privacy under the terms of the GDPR. The long-running complaint concerned data belonging to minors, particularly phone numbers and email addresses, which was made more public when some young users upgraded their profiles to business accounts to access analytics tools such as profile visits. Instagram’s owner, Meta, said it planned to appeal against the decision. “This inquiry focused on old settings that we updated over a year ago and we’ve since released many new features to help keep teens safe and their information private,” aMeta official told BBC News. “While we’ve engaged fully with the DPC throughout their inquiry, we disagree with how this fine was calculated and intend to appeal it.” Andy Burrows, child-safety-online policy head at the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) said, “This was a major breach that had significant safeguarding implications and the potential to cause real harm to children using Instagram. The ruling demonstrates how effective enforcement can protect children on social media and underlines how regulation is already making children safer online.” In September 2023, TikTok was handed a €345 million ($370 million) fine by theIrish Data Protection Commission(DPC) for violating children’s data privacy, under GDPR law. The DPC found that TikTok had not been transparent enough with children about its privacy settings, and raised questions about how their data was processed. The inquiry sought to examine the extent to which, during the period between July 31 2020 and December 31 2020, TikTok complied with its obligations under the GDPR in relation to its processing of personal data relating to child users of the TikTok platform in the context of: Certain TikTok platform settings, including public-by-default settings as well as the settings associated with the Family Pairing feature. Age verification as part of the registration process. “As part of the inquiry, the DPC also examined certain of TTL’s transparency obligations, including the extent of information provided to child users in relation to default settings,” the IDC said. The DPC’s decision, which was adopted on September 1, 2023, recorded findings of infringement of Articles 5(1)(c), 5(1)(f), 24(1), 25(1), 25(2), 12(1), 13(1)(e) and 5(1)(a) GDPR, relating to a range of matters including data security, data protection by design, and data processing. A spokesperson for the social media firm told media outlets, “We respectfully disagree with the decision, particularly the level of the fine imposed.” In July 2022, mobile communications giant T-Mobile announced the terms of a settlement for a consolidated class action lawsuit following a data breach that occurred in early 2021, impacting an estimated 77 million people. The incident centered around “unauthorized access” to T-Mobile’s systems after a portion of customer data was listed for sale on a known cybercriminal forum. In anSEC filing, it was revealed that T-Mobile would pay an aggregate of $350 million to fund claims submitted by class members, the legal fees of plaintiffs’ counsel, and the costs of administering the settlement. The company would also commit to an aggregate incremental spend of $150 million for data security and related technology in 2022 and 2023. “The company anticipates that, upon court approval, the settlement will provide a full release of all claims arising out of the cyberattack by class members, who do not opt-out, against all defendants, including the company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and its directors and officers,” the filing read. “The settlement contains no admission of liability, wrongdoing or responsibility by any of the defendants. Class members consist of all individuals whose personal information was compromised in the breach, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the agreement. The company believes that terms of the proposed settlement are in line with other settlements of similar types of claims,” it added. In October 2024, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC)fined LinkedIn€310 million ($335 million) for processing user data without proper consent, violating the GDPR. The Microsoft-owned platform used members’ personal information for behavioral analysis and targeted advertising without obtaining transparent, informed, or unambiguous consent. This fine is among the largest levied against a tech company for GDPR violations. LinkedIn plans to revise its ad practices to comply with the DPC’s demands, despite asserting its belief that it has complied with the regulation. In November 2022, theIreland Data Protection Commission (DPC) fined Meta $277 million(€265 million) for the compromise of 500 million users’ personal information. The DPC started its inquiry on April 14, 2021, following reports of a collated data set of Facebook personal data that had been made available on the internet. The scope of the inquiry concerned an examination and assessment of Facebook Search, Facebook Messenger Contact Importer, and Instagram Contact Importer tools in relation to the processing carried out by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (“MPIL”) during the period between May 25, 2018, and September 2019. “The material issues in this inquiry concerned questions of compliance with the GDPR obligation for Data Protection by Design and Default,” the DPC wrote. “The DPC examined the implementation of technical and organizational measures pursuant to Article 25 GDPR (which deals with this concept). There was a comprehensive inquiry process, including cooperation with all of the other data protection supervisory authorities within the EU. Those supervisory authorities agreed with the decision of the DPC.” The decision imposed a reprimand and an order requiring MPIL to bring its processing into compliance by taking a range of specified remedial actions within a particular timeframe. In September 2024, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC)fined Meta €251 million($263.5 million) for a 2018 Facebook breach that exposed the personal data of 29 million users. The breach, caused by a flaw in the “view as” feature, compromised sensitive information such as names, contact details, and locations. Despite addressing the issue and reporting it, Meta faced GDPR violations, contributing to a growing total of over $3 billion in fines. Meta plans to appeal the fine, citing the steps it has taken to enhance user data protection since the incident. Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp was fined €225 million ($255 million) in August 2021 for a series of GDPR cross-border data protection infringements in Ireland. The fine followed alengthy investigation and enforcement processwhich began in 2018 and involved the Data Protection Commission’s proposed decision and sanctions being rejected by its counterpart European data protection regulators, resulting in a referral to and ruling from the European Data Protection Board. Allegations focused on complaints from users and non-users of WhatsApp’s services, involving alleged breaches of transparency and data subject information obligations under articles 12, 13, and 14 of the GDPR. In 2014 Home Depot was involved in one of the largest data breaches to date involving a point-of-sale (POS) system, leading to a number of fines and settlements being paid. Stolen credentials from a third party enabled attackers to enter Home Depot’s network, elevate privileges, and eventually compromise the POS system. More than 50 million credit card numbers and 53 million email addresses were stolen over a five-month period between April and September 2014. Home Depot has reportedly paid out at least $134.5 million to credit card companies and banks as a result of the breach. In addition, in 2016 Home Depot agreed to pay $19.5 million to customers that had been affected by the breach, which included the cost of credit monitoring services to breach victims. In 2017 the firm agreed to pay an additional $25 million to the financial institutions affected by the breach that could be claimed by victims and cover banks’ losses. Breaches can have a longtail of costs, especially when it comes to fines and settlements. In November 2020, the retailer paid a further $17.5 million settlement to 46 US states and Washington DC for the breach. The agreement also compels Home Depot to employ a highly qualified CISO, provide security training for key personnel, and ensure security controls and policies in areas like identity and access, monitoring, and incident response. In December 2021, Capital One agreed to pay $190 million to settle a class-action lawsuit filed against it by U.S. customers over a2019 data breachthat affected 100 million people. This settlement comes more than a year after the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency fined Capital One $80 million for the same breach (see below). A software engineer at AWS was behind the attack, which exposed information including bank account details. “While Capital One and AWS deny all liability, in the interest of avoiding the time, expense and uncertainty of continued litigation, plaintiffs and Capital One have executed a term sheet containing the essential terms of a class settlement that, if approved by this court, will fully resolve all claims brought by plaintiffs,” a filing with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia read. In an emailed statement, Capital One said that key facts in the case had not changed since it announced the event in coordination with federal authorities more than two years ago, with the hacker arrested and the stolen data recovered before it could be disseminated or used for fraudulent purposes. “We are pleased to have reached an agreement that will resolve the consumer class litigation in the U.S.,” the company added. In 2016 ride-hailing app Uber had 600,000 driver and 57 million user accounts breached. Instead of reporting the incident, the company paid the perpetrator $100,000 to keep the hack under wraps. Those actions, however, cost the company dearly. The company was fined $148 million in 2018 — the biggest data breach fine in history at the time — for violation of state data breach notification laws. In January 2022, investment bank and financial services giantMorgan Stanley agreed to pay $60 millionto settle a legal claim relating to its data security. The agreement, if approved by a federal judge in Manhattan, will resolve a class-action lawsuit was that filed against the company in July 2020 regarding two security breaches that compromised the personal data of approximately 15 million customers. According to claimants, Morgan Stanley failed to protect the personally identifiable information (PII) of current and former clients. It is alleged data center equipment decommissioned by the firm in 2016 and 2019 was not efficiently wiped clean and a software flaw meant that unencrypted, sensitive data was visible to whoever purchased the equipment. The proposed claim settlement comes more than a year after Morgan Stanley was handed a separate $60 million civil penalty bythe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)in relation to the same incidents. The OCC stated that Morgan Stanley failed “to exercise proper oversight of the 2016 decommissioning of two Wealth Management business data centers located in the U.S. Among other things, the banks failed to effectively assess or address risks associated with decommissioning its hardware; failed to adequately assess the risk of subcontracting the decommissioning work, including exercising adequate due diligence in selecting a vendor and monitoring its performance; and failed to maintain appropriate inventory of customer data stored on the decommissioned hardware devices.” In 2019, the banks experienced similar vendor management control deficiencies in connection with decommissioning other network devices that also stored customer data, the OCC added. In a statement on the recent settlement agreement, Morgan Stanley said: “We have previously notified all potentially impacted clients regarding these matters, which occurred several years ago, and are pleased to be resolving this related litigation.” Google Ireland was hit by a €90 million ($102 million) fine by French data protection authority the CNIL on January 6, 2022. The fine related to how Google’s European arm implements cookie consent procedures on YouTube. “The CNIL has received many complaints about the way cookies can be refused on the websites google.fr and youtube.com,”it wrote. “In June 2021, the CNIL carried out an online investigation on these websites and found that, while they offer a button allowing immediate acceptance of cookies, the sites do not implement an equivalent solution (button or other) enabling the user to refuse the deposit of cookies equally easily. Several clicks are required to refuse all cookies, against a single one to accept them.” The restricted committee considered that this process affected the freedom of consent of internet users and constituted an infringement of Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act.

Among these wasthe book“Understanding Covert Channel Analysis of Trusted Systems”,initially published in 1983. It is one of the earliest documents in the digital era that spelled out how to operate covertly and deceptively online without compromising system security, laying the foundation for what is now known as deception technology. But deception technology, or methods for luring bad actors into digital traps, has come a long way since then. Modern deception technology involves dedicating some computer assets to house fabricated yet realistic and complex digital records, which makes them attractive lures for cybercriminals and other malicious actors. For some major organizations, deception efforts could become real-world productions, complete with phony social media profiles, fake office sets, and even actors pretending to be employees, all to snooker the bad guys into a dead-end. “Deception operations are useful to conduct, but you have to have a robust infrastructure,” threat intel hacker and former FBI computer scientist Russell Handorfsaidduring a presentation at this year’s Shmoocon conference. “You have to know the cadence. You have to have a lot of that other foundational stuff in play. If you do have that stuff in play and decide to run a deception operation, it is a strong signal that something hinky is going on in your infrastructure.” The goal of deception technology, also known as deception techniques, operations, or tools, is to create an environment that attracts and deceives adversaries to divert them from targeting the organization’s crown jewels. Rapid7definesdeception technology as “a category of incident detection and response technology that helps security teams detect, analyze, and defend against advanced threats by enticing attackers to interact with false IT assets deployed within your network.” Most cybersecurity professionals are familiar with the current most common application of deception technology,honeypots, which are computer systems sacrificed to attract malicious actors. But experts say honeypots are merely decoys deployed as part of what should be more overarching efforts to invite shrewd and easily angered adversaries to buy elaborate deceptions. Companies selling honeypots “may not be thinking about what it takes to develop, enact, and roll out an actual deception operation,” Handorf said. “As I stressed, you have to know your infrastructure. You have to have a handle on your inventory, the log analysis in your case. But you also have to think that a deception operation is not a honeypot. It is more than a honeypot. It is a strategy that you have to think about and implement very decisively and with willful intent.” Deepen Desai, CSO and head of security research at Zscaler, compares deception operations to motion detectors. “If I were to draw an analogy, you have locks, keys, and doors to protect your house from bad guys getting in. But when bad guys get in, whether they’re pretending to be the good guys or they’re already inside, it’s the motion sensors that you tactically place at spots in the house that are not easily visible but raise the alarm when someone is at a place where you don’t expect them to be.” A critical component of deception technology is the creation of assets that criminals and other threat actors believe are real, at least for a while, lest they quickly exit or avoid them altogether, which would render the deception operation useless. “You’re not going to be able to do it perfectly because you’re going to always leave some sort of weird footprint, a little flag,” Handorf tells CSO. Getting the details right for highly elaborate deception operations is particularly important. Assets that appear fake, such as 1,000 computers all unrealistically built precisely the same way, “tip off the adversary that it’s not a real deception,” Handorf says. “Something about the host isn’t exactly right. It’s too symmetrical. In movies, people walk in, and they are like, ‘Wait, there’s something about this room that just doesn’t feel right. It’s way too convenient,’ and then, all the cops show up.” Thom Langford, EMEA CTO of Rapid7, tells CSO that although his organization has succeeded in past deception operations,” it became apparent quite quickly that the more serious attackers, the more serious threat actors found out what was going on rather quickly. They realized they were dealing with deceptive technology. That immediately diminishes its value.” Even worse, Handorf says, “Once the actor gets in and they start seeing that stuff, you could piss them off, you can make them angry, you can make them frustrated, and they may want to hurt you more.” Desai says that threat actors caught in deception operations can, like most people, behave in various ways. “Some will exfiltrate data, remove all the traces, wipe out all the evidence, and get out of that environment. But then there are those who were unable to hit their mission objective and were like, ‘Okay, my cover is blown. Let me now destroy everything that I have access to and get out.’ So, you can end up with either.” The desire of some threat actors to wreak havoc is why Desai recommends that organizations implement a zero-trust architecture first. “This is where you need to have the deception technology integrated with your zero-trust platform. As soon as someone gets trapped by your deception technology, you automatically isolate them from the real environment.” Aside from serving as a motion detector to alert admins of intrusions, deception operations can help gather intelligence on who the adversaries are, which is helpful information for subsequently notifying law enforcement. “The threat actor is now identified, and that can be passed on,” Handorf says. “And then their social networking, their means of communication will be illuminated at that point for future interdiction.” Even as deception operations prove helpful to this intelligence-gathering on external adversaries, they can also help pinpoint insider threat actors. Desai says, “The more important and effective use case that I’m seeing with the large organizations I speak with is for insider threat, or these compromised assets use cases where a malicious insider is trying to poke around in your environment and getting to a destination that he doesn’t need to be to do his job.” Moreover, establishing deception operations could fulfill some requirements under cyber insurance policies. Insurers might say, “Prove to us that you have got a handle on your environment, on your network, and the investment of a couple of thousand dollars a year to drop a couple of these boxes in is probably quite a sound investment in instances like that,” Rapid7’s Langford says. During his Shmoocon talk, Handorf offered his own real-world example of establishing deception technology on 40 acres of land he and his wife purchased. As it turned out, the land was overrun by squatters, illegal hunters, and other undesirable trespassers. To tackle the problem, he created a company called the Rattlesnake Sanctuary, planted signs around his property containing QR codes for trespassers with cellphones to learn more about the sanctuary, erected a network of cameras and speakers, and studied his land to determine where and how to place these assets. His goal was to “ultimately collect as much information about the trespassers that are up there and then, when warranted, pass it on to law enforcement for them to do their job.” However, this kind of elaborate operation writ larger on a corporate scale is reserved only for the biggest corporations, some of which go to extensive lengths in their deception techniques. “There are companies in the US that run deception operations really, really well,” Handorf says, suggesting that many of these are financial institutions with lots of international agreements. “They create fake departments. They have fake division heads. You can fabricate a person’s face, but you don’t want to because that’s still easily discoverable. You can hire actors; you could hire other human beings if you need to go that far to play these particular roles, to come into a place, sit down and drink coffee, and follow a script of emails. A lot of this is what you would experience in a world where your adversary has a lot of deep pockets to want to get the crown jewels that you have.” But, for most organizations, this level of deception is unnecessary. “For what I would describe as mid-enterprise organizations, the majority of the time they’re trying to protect probably against ransomware as well as making sure their intellectual property doesn’t leave from one to two ways, either via an insider threat or an external adversary intentionally targeting. Infosec 101 covers the majority of that.” “Setting up effectively fake fronts is probably for the realms of the few rather than the many,” Langford says. “It depends on what you are defending against, and it depends on what your threat profile is, what your threat surface is, and how important it is.” Langford recommends that most companies hire outside firms to run ordinary deception operations. “Most organizations probably can’t deal with it alone, and they’d have to call in folks from the outside,” he says. Bringing in outside experts is particularly important given that ill-conceived deception operations can carry legal risks because they might accidentally cause threat actors to infiltrate other organizations or could induce employees to allege entrapment. “That is part of the problem,” Langford says.  “The risk of not doing this is high. The risk of doing this is high.” But, he says, “That’s why I say you need to build a plan, know your scope, know what you’re going to do, know why you’re going to do it, document why you’re going to do it, document the benefits, et cetera. It’s a far easier conversation with your legal department or your general counsel or external counsel as opposed to just rocking up and saying, ‘Hey, we are going to encourage attackers to come into our network.'” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS Australian financial firm hit with lawsuit after massive data breach Generative AI red teaming: Tips and techniques for

7 reasons security breach sources remain unknown,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3600490/7-reasons-security-breach-sources-remain-unknown.html,"Many security leaders remain clueless about the cause of recent security incidents their organizations have experienced, calling into question how much can be learned. Absence of proper detection and monitoring systems Spotty incident response planning Budgetary constraints Increasingly sophisticated and stealthy attacks Overly complex (and disconnected) security stacks Alert fatigue Corporate culture that undermines effective security strategy Action plan Related content Australian financial firm hit with lawsuit after massive data breach Suite 404: Training executives for cyberattack response in a playful way 4 key trends reshaping the SIEM market How to create an effective incident response plan Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  One-third of companies still don’t know what caused their data security incidents over the past year, and three-quarters say it’s becoming more complex to understand their security tech stack — two key statistics that underscore the challenges security teams face in improving operations in the wake of being breached. According toFoundry/CSO’s Security Priorities Study 2024, only 67% of security leaders are aware of what caused data security incidents at their organizations in the past 12 months. Detecting the causes of breaches has become increasingly complex due to several converging factors. First, identifying that a breach has occurred remains a significant challenge. According to areport from IBM, firms take an average of 207 days to identify a breach — and an additional 70 days to contain it. As a result, root cause analysis might not come into focus until at least nine months after initial access, leaving organizations hard-pressed to pinpoint causes and thus learn from security incidents. Moreover, spotting security incidents and understanding their origins is becoming more challenging not least because attackers are becoming more skilled at avoiding detection. “Today’s attacks are often AI-driven and tailored for stealth, making it difficult to detect breaches at their inception,” says Andrew Rose, CSO at security awareness platform SoSafe. “Financial constraints and a shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals mean many organizations lack the resources to swiftly identify, investigate, and trace threats.” All these issues are compounded by the challenges of securing remote work environments and IoT devices, many of which were never designed with security in mind, leaving visibility gaps that attackers can readily exploit. Security experts canvassed by CSO broke down the breach detection problem into the following distinct challenges. Finding the root cause of a breach relies on robust monitoring and forensic capabilities. And when security operations are outsourced —as they increasingly are— lack of familiarity with the business can play a role. Brian Jack, CISO at KnowBe4, says a number of factors repeatedly crop up in breaches he has investigated. “I saw several times that a breach went unnoticed for a lengthy period of time because the SOC [security operations center] function had been largely outsourced to a third party and that third party failed to notify the customer of suspicious events,” Jack explains. “Third-party SOCs often lack the knowledge, not the skill, to tell if certain events that trigger alerts are something worth investigating,” he says. “It is very helpful in a SOC to have knowledge about the business, who the personnel are, and what organizational changes might be happening.” Having aclear incident response planin place prepares an organization for the task of investigating and uncovering the root cause of a breach if one should occur. Paul McLatchie, security strategy consultant at Daisy Corporate Services, tells CSO: “Cyber breaches are not a case of ‘if,’ but ‘when,’ which is why organizations must be prepared by creating and following an incident response plan.” Cyber incident response focuses on rapidly identifying security events and incidents within the organization, validating their scope and impact, and enabling effective mitigative and remedial measures in addressing them. Response plans must also extend into post-event analysis and consideration of lessons learned, so that the root cause of a breach can be identified and lessons to prevent any repetition are learned. Understanding the cause of a breach and safeguarding against future issues is important because organizations unable to learn from incidents will be highly susceptible to further breaches. “An ineffective plan, or steps that are not followed precisely, leads to issues,” says McLatchie. “Often organizations can ignore the final stages of an incident response plan and rush their return to operations.” McLatchie warns: “This results in insufficient root cause analysis of the breach, or in some cases crucial evidence being inadvertently destroyed.” KnowBe4’s Jack agrees that thorough analysis is valuable in the long run. “Having log visibility to as many assets as possible and retaining those logs for a long enough period to have sufficient coverage to do investigations can be costly,” he says. “However, it is important in early detection and complete investigation of key breach events.” Security budgets are stretched thin, so many businesses are failing to invest in resources that make it easier to trace the source of a breach. Graeme Stewart, head of public sector at Check Point Software, said that breach detection challenges are compounded by limited staffing and procedural gaps. “With tight budgets and staffing pressures, getting systems back online becomes the immediate focus,” Stewart says. “This often means putting out the fire first, then cleaning up the aftermath, and only then understanding what caused it in the first place.” Limited budgets often result in understaffed teams, limited capacity forroot-cause analysis, and inadequate forensic capabilities. Small and midsize firms are specifically challenged to promptly identify problems, says Conor O’Neill, cybersecurity expert and CEO and co-founder of pen-testing platform OnSecurity. “Small businesses are more vulnerable to cyberattacks than larger corporations; this is due to limited budgets, a lack of in-house security functions, and a shortage of trained staff who know how to handle and prevent data breaches, all crucial for identifying data breaches,” he says. As attacks become more sophisticated it can become more difficult to unpack the cause of problems, says Raj Samani, SVP and chief scientist at security firm Rapid7. “We must acknowledge that many threat groups take measures to obfuscate their tracks, invariably making any investigation more challenging,” he says. “However, this is often only part of the reason why identifying the source of the breach is so difficult.” Samani adds: “Whilst technologies will aid the investigation, the time spent retroactively reviewing such incidents often competes with the urgency of the next issue, or indeed, the demand to get the environment operational again.” Many breaches are detected long after they occur, and delays make it harder to identify root causes. Here, time is on the side of an attacker, with computer forensic capabilities fading over time as data is amended, overwritten, and deleted. “Hackers are always finding new ways to blend into regular network traffic, so even the best detection systems can end up playing a never-ending game of ‘whack-a-mole’ with threats,” says Peter Wood, CTO at Spectrum Search. “And while the systems might flag something suspicious, figuring out exactly where it started is another story altogether.” Attackers are increasingly stealing and using legitimate user credentials to evade detection, move laterally across systems, and blend in with regular network activity, adds David Spencer, director of technical product management at Immersive Labs. “The situation is further complicated as most attacks involve capturing credentials from clear text files, password managers, or memory dumps, making it nearly impossible to distinguish between attacker and victim,” he says. “It’s like searching for a [specific] needle in a growing stack of needles.” Complexity of the security tech stack is also a growing issue. “Many companies use multiple systems, applications, and tools, which often don’t integrate,” says Benson Varghese, founder and managing partner of US law firm Varghese Summersett. Like solving a puzzle without all the pieces, determining where a breach occurred is difficult when systems fail to fit together. “I’ve had clients using a mix of security solutions, some of which were outdated or didn’t communicate,” Varghese tells CSO. “My client’s breach went undetected for months because their monitoring system wasn’t aligned with their security infrastructure.” Varghese adds: “The trail was cold when they realized what was happening.” Many firms areburdened with technical debt, relying on outdated systems that lack comprehensive logging capabilities, making it difficult to track and analyze incidents in detail. “One of the primary issues lies in detection and monitoring, complicated further by increasingly intricate security tech stacks,” says Kennet Harpsøe, lead security researcher at Logpoint. “Without cohesive integration among tools, critical indicators of compromise can easily be missed or delayed, leaving security teams overwhelmed by massive amounts of data — a situation where the signal is often lost in the noise of false positives.” Ben Jarlett, senior application analyst at London Metropolitan University, tells CSO: “Security information and event management [SIEM] systems and extended detection and response [XDR] platforms can help, but they require proper tuning, regular updates, and skilled management to be effective.” Jarlett adds: “In many cases, companies either underutilize these systems or face a barrage of false positives, which can obscure genuine threats and delay the identification of root causes.” Lewis Duke, SecOps and threat intelligence lead at Trend Micro, believes consolidation of security tech stacks can help. “Organizations are much better prepared when utilizing consolidated and correlated tooling to provide real context and remove operational overhead when it comes to investigation,” he says. “This is why we are seeing such an industry shift towards a platform-based security strategy that allows for faster, more effective IR [incident response], as well as obvious benefits around the cost and skills required to operate a reduced tech stack.” Security monitoring systems generate millions of daily alerts, overwhelming SOCs and making it harder to isolate malicious behavior. The high volume of false-positive alerts generated by many security systems creates an overwhelming “signal-to-noise” problem. “Analysts are often flooded with alerts, making it a daunting task to isolate genuine threats and determine their root causes,” says Logpoint’s Harpsøe. Ultimately, addressing these challenges requires improved integration of detection tools, more effective prioritization of alerts, and a strategic emphasis on maintaining comprehensive visibility across all assets. Some organizations may not fully prioritize cybersecurity as part of their corporate culture, making it exceedingly challenging to uncover root causes. “Despite recognizing the importance of security, many companies focus primarily on regulatory compliance, investing in cybersecurity tools to meet minimum standards without fostering a proactive security mindset,” says London Metropolitan University’s Jarlett. Stephen McDermid, CSO for EMEA at Okta, argues that security leaders need to take the lead in forging an open and responsive corporate security culture. “It’s the CSO’s responsibility to encourage people to make threats visible and escalate potential risks,” McDermid says. “If employees are fearful to raise issues and attempt to solve them alone, this may delay critical responses.” Companies can improve their resilience by investing in improved cybersecurity measures, staff training, incident response planning, and investment in detection and forensic capabilities. “Focus on data breach prevention with tools such as vulnerability scanners and penetration testing that identify vulnerabilities and potential breaches before they hit,” OnSecurity’s O’Neill says.

AiTM attacks are insidious and can have serious consequences Preventing AiTM attacks requires a combination of techniques Investigation and clean-up after an AiTM attack Determine the depth and severity of the attack OneDrive users should get an additional layer of scrutiny Related content The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time Australian financial firm hit with lawsuit after massive data breach Aptori Now on Google Cloud Marketplace for AI-Powered Security and Automated Risk Remediation Security operations centers are fundamental to cybersecurity — here’s how to build one Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  An office worker received an email that appeared to be from a vendor but was caught in quarantine and the user requested its release. It looked innocent enough, so an administrator released the email. The user clicked on the email to review the contents, which included an attached invoice. That’s where the trouble started: clicking on the attachment launched a website that requested the worker’s username and password, which they dutifully entered. Unfortunately, there was nothing legitimate about the email, which was phishing for just such an opportunity. But it got worse — the user had unwittingly given the attacker the ability to go one step further and launch anadversary in the middle(AiTM) attack, the ultimate business email compromise that seeks to gain entry to banking or other financial transactions.These attacksnot only grab credentials, but they can also snare tokens to bypass multifactor authentication. Several levels of security had failed, and the attackers were now able to infiltrate the network stealthily, impersonate the target and access email conversations and documents in the cloud. “In a stolen session cookie replay attack, the attacker uses the valid stolen cookie to impersonate the user, circumventing authentication mechanisms of passwords and MFA,” Microsoft notes in its blog on the subject. “In this campaign, we observed that the attacker signed in with the stolen cookie after a few hours from an IP address based in the United States…. In addition, the attacker generated a new access token, allowing them to persist longer in the environment.” Once inside, attackers can add new authentication methods to bypass those already in place, often with the goal of building a rule to divert certain mail so that the user or owner of the mailbox doesn’t see it being sent. To prevent AiTM attacks, Microsoft recommends using security defaults as a baseline set of policies to improve identity security posture. For more granular control, you’ll want to enable conditional access policies; implementing risk-based access policies is particularly helpful. “Conditional access policies evaluate sign-in requests using additional identity-driven signals like user or group membership, IP location information, and device status, among others, and are enforced for suspicious sign-ins,” according to Microsoft. “Organizations can protect themselves from attacks that leverage stolen credentials by enabling policies such as compliant devices, trusted IP address requirements, or risk-based policies with proper access control.” Invest in advanced anti-phishing solutions as a front-line defense, specifically solutions that monitor and scan incoming emails and visited websites. Ensure that you use SmartScreen and other technologies that block malicious websites. Investigate suspected malicious activities, hunting for sign-in attempts with suspicious characteristics and enable rule sets that look for unusual activity or other more obvious attack processes that identify risky locations, malicious ISPs, unusual user agents, and the use of anonymizer services. While Microsoft’s AiTM blog discusses what you should do to prevent business email compromise, it’s a bit weak on the specifics of how you should investigate and clean up after the potential attack. You want to ensure your log files for Microsoft 365 are offloaded to a security event and incident management (SEIM) platform and review the Entra or Azure sign-in logs with interactive and non-interactive logins and review any location that isn’t “normal.” Note that if the user is on a cellular connection, location may be difficult to determine as normal and may differ geographically from the IP addresses you are used to. It may take some time to correlate what the user was doing and what device they were logging on to. Ensure that you interview and correlate the dates, times, and events with what the user was doing and document accordingly. Then download the Unified Audit logs athttp://compliance.microsoft.com. From here you can investigate what the attacker did, especially if you have a subscription to the full Microsoft 365 suite that includes OneDrive and Teams. You’ll want to review activities in Outlook, Teams, SharePoint, OneDrive, Power Automate, and any other corporate assets that the user had access to. Ensure that you obtain the logs and keep them for the compromised user in your SEIM or other device. Depending on the impact of the attack, start the cleanup process. Start by forcing a password change on the user account, ensuring that you have revoked all tokens to block the attacker’s fake credentials. If the consequences of the attack were severe, consider disabling the user’s primary account and setting up a new temporary account as you investigate the extent of the intrusion. You may even consider quarantining the user’s devices and potentially taking forensic-level backups of workstations if you are unsure of the original source of the intrusion so you can best investigate. Next review all app registrations, changes to service principals, enterprise apps, and anything else the user may have changed or impacted since the time the intrusion was noted. You’ll want to do a deep investigation into the mailbox’s access and permissions. Mandiant has aPowerShell-based scriptthat can assist you in investigating the impact of the intrusion “This repository contains a PowerShell module for detecting artifacts that may be indicators ofUNC2452and other threat actor activity,” Mandiant notes. “Some indicators are ‘high-fidelity’ indicators of compromise, while other artifacts are so-called ‘dual-use’ artifacts.” “Dual-use artifacts may be related to threat actor activity, but also may be related to legitimate functionality. Analysis and verification will be required for these.” Mandiant does caution that the tool “will not Identify a compromise 100% of the time, or tell you if an artifact is legitimate admin activity or threat actor activity.” If your user is accessing Microsoft’s OneDrive, you’ll want to check the file dates of files on the cloud storage to see if anything has been tampered with or impacted by malware. Check Power Automate and Power Apps to determine whether post-exploitation command and control or custom command and control has been set up for the user in question. Next, ensure that the user’s single-sign-on impact has been limited and that you review the impact athttp://myapps.microsoft.com. Then, as with consumer devices noted above, similarly verify that all registered or joined devices for the user are legitimate inhttp://admin.microsoft.comandhttp://entra.microsoft.com. It’s strongly recommended that you implementCenter for Internet Security settingsbased on the license you have. Some of these recommended settings cannot be done with the cheapest Microsoft 365 license and require a Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription at a minimum.

Security awareness training seeks to reduce human cyber risk by ensuring employees can understand, identify, and avoid information security threats as a first line of organizational defense. Most employees remain uninformed about cyberattack techniques that impact their daily work but also how to respond to them. A well-tailored security awareness training program will help them understand whatcybersecurity threats they might encounter in their own role and howthey can adapt security best practices as part of their workflow — without overloading them with more tasks or information than they need to do their jobs effectively. Most employees don’t see cybersecurity being part of their job. As a result, they need to be provided training to understand the vital role they play in helping defend the organization from cyberattacks. There are two main reasons for this: Humans are cybersecuritys’ weakest link.Business users may be correct to think that tasks such as rolling outendpoint protection suitesare somebody else’s problem (specifically, the cybersecurity team’s). But as the SANS Institute points out in its Security Awareness Report, “People have become the primary attack vector for cyber-attackers around the world.” Kapersky’s “Redefining the Human Factor in Cybersecurity” report found that 64% of cybersecurity incidents were caused by human error. As such, everyone in your organization must be aware of the threats they face. SANS specifically calls outphishingandbusiness email compromiseas two of the top three threats to organizations today. Cybersecurity pros cannot sit next to their coworkers every day to intercept these kinds ofsocial engineeringattacks, so security awareness training is necessary to keep everyone aware of potential threats and how not to fall prey to them. Security awareness is often mandated by government and industry regulatory frameworks.Toensure greater security overall, many industry-standard security frameworks include regular security training as part of their mandates. This is particularly true in highly regulated industries where privacy and security are paramount. HIPAA, for example,mandates“a security awareness and training program for all members of its workforce including management” for any company or organization that handles healthcare data.PCI DSS does as wellforcompanies that accept credit card payments. The truth is, for most organizations, security awareness training isn’t just a good idea: It’s required. Security awareness training should focus on topics nontechnical employees need to know about — and can act on. Training on the following are essential: Phishing and social engineering.Social engineering scams — not just email phishing butvoiceandtextscams as well — are the No. 1 way attackers get access to a company’s systems, data, and finances. As such, employees must be educated on how these attacks work as well as how to spot their tell-tale signs and what to do if they encounter such a situation. Beyond straightforward education, one of the most common types of security awareness training involves sending fake phishing emails to employees and rewarding them (with anything from praise to gift cards) if they successfully spot them and report them to IT. Higher-risk employees, such as executives and those with access to company financial accounts, should get more intensive training on the more targetedspear phishingattacks they’re likely to face. Passwords.Boring but still a linchpin of corporate IT security, properpassword hygieneis another key topic for security awareness training. If you roll out apassword manager for your business, its optimal use can be a covered by this topic as well. Personal device use and remote work.Imposing a strict work/life distinction on employees is for most organizations a lost cause: Employees inevitablyuse corporate devices for personal browsingand answer work emails and texts on their personal phones. The boundaries have been further blurred by the post-pandemic rise ofremote work. Employees need to know how best to navigate this landscape. Incident reporting.In addition to learning to recognize potential cyberattack dangers, employees must also learnhow to report them to your teamso you can do something about it. It is also worthwhile to stress why it is important to report incidents to the security team, as what may seem an obvious phishing attempt to one employee may not be obvious to another. Alerting the security team can help ensure such attempts, which often target a wide range of employees, are quickly addressed. We’ve covered the whyand whatof security awareness, but the howmakes all the difference in ensuring training is effective.Here are the building blocks of a good security awareness training program: Content — and lots of ways to deliver it.Obviously, you need the gather the information you want your employees to learn, but you’ll also want to serve up this knowledge in a variety of formats, including videos, blog posts, interactive scenarios (like the simulated phishing emails mentioned above), lunch and learn sessions, and more. And yes, this allneeds to be funas far as workplace training can be. Both the information and delivery methods should be customized to various employee groups: the CEO and entry-level sales associates both need security awareness, but should get it according to their needs. Support within your organization.No matter how fun your content is, it isn’t going to succeed if you don’t get buy-in for your training program across your organization. Getting executive leadership on board is vital, and individual departments must also be involved in the rollout and consulted rather than having another mandate foisted upon them. Working with HR is also key, as HR is not only a key department for training programs but also a vital partner in helping enforce completion mandates and targets. An incentive structure.Whether it’s gift cards, continuing education credits, or public acknowledgements, you need some method to make learners feels like superstars when they do well in the program. A plan to quantify the results.Security awareness training isn’t a one-and-done deal — you need to keep track of who’s doing well, and what areas need further attention. This will help you craft the program going forward and explain to leadership how the training is improving security around the company. For a deeper dive on all this, check out “7 elements of a successful security awareness program“ and “4 steps to launch a security awareness training program.” Many organizations choose to contract with an external vendor to provide security awareness training services. Though there are anumber of criteria you can use to judge these companies, cost is going to be an important factor that in turn depends on the level of service you receive, ranging from self-service platforms that provide learning modules to full-service consultants who run training for your staff in person. Caniphishbreaks down the numbers across the spectrum of vendors, estimating that costs can range from $0.45 to $6 per employee per month depending on the level of service, with most vendors offering discounts for larger employee pools. Even if leadership has bought into the idea of security training, price will likely be a concern you will need to justify. Can ROI for security awareness training be computed? In a 2017 study, Aberdeen Group attempted torun the numbersto determine the value of an “incremental” security awareness training program, comparing the price against potential losses to phishing and other classic human-focused security attacks. It concluded that such programs result in a median reduction in the risk of phishing attacks of about 50%, and a median 5X annual return on investment. These numbers are widely trumpeted by security awareness training vendors, but could provide a baseline to take to organizational leadership. You can also use variousindustry-standard IT risk assessment frameworksto quantify the cybersecurity risks your organization faces; this is another tool in your arsenal to convince management of the value of security awareness training. For organizations that want to build trainings internally, there are plenty of great free and open-source resources out there: The US federal government’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency offers a number oftrainings and exercises, and while these are tailored specifically for the needs of federal employees, many are free to use for the public. NIST’s cybersecurity division offers aroundup of free and low-cost cybersecurity learning content. The SANS institute offers anumber of resources for free, including free trainings. Cyber101.comoffers introductory cybersecurity training free of charge. SC Training offersa good list of free cybersecurity training coursesfor various kinds of organizations and employees. Gophishis an open-source framework that allows you to simulate phishing attacks to test your employees. Implementing these tools will take time and internal resources, but you may find they help strike a balance between cost and security needs. Good luck!

Cryptojacking 9. Emerging quantum threats to encryption 10. Emerging AI-assisted attacks 11. Tougher regulatory regimes Related content CIOs and CISOs take on NIS2: Key challenges, security opportunities Australian financial firm hit with lawsuit after massive data breach CIOs and CISOs grapple with DORA: Key challenges, compliance complexities 21% of CISOs pressured to not report compliance issues Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  The financial sector faces a wide array of serious security threats that will only increase as cybercriminals make greater use of AI. Financial sector firms are uniquely exposed tocyber riskdue to the large amounts of sensitive data and transactions they process. Common cyber risks across the sector include phishing, ransomware, data breaches, denial-of-service attacks, and advanced persistent threats. The shift to hybrid work models, the increasing adoption of cloud computing, and the emergence of novel threats against legacy cryptography heap further pressure on hard-pressed financial sector CISOs — who already face the burden of achieving compliance with numerous laws, regulations, and standards governing the sector. Following are the most significant cyber threats financial companies face today. Two-thirds (65%) of financial institutions worldwidereported ransomware attacks in 2024, a sharp rise from 34% in 2021, according to Statista. The average ransom demand is US$4.2 million, according torecent research by cybersecurity reviews website Comparitech, which found the average ransomware paid out was even higher, at US$7.4 million. Comparitech identified a total of 395 individualransomwareattacks on financial organizations over recent years with peaks in 2023 (105) and 2021 (104). “Organizations need to be mindful that paying a ransom might return access to systems but doesn’t remove attacker access or necessarily prevent them selling the data they’ve successfully targeted,” warns David Higgins, senior director of the field technology office at identity management vendor CyberArk. More generally, malware attacks against finance sector firms doubled last year, according tonetwork security vendor SonicWall. The financial services industry is also a prime target for brand impersonation attacks due to its vast amounts of sensitive data, such as banking credentials andpersonally identifiable information (PII). Two-thirds (68%) of identified phishing pages from August 2023 through July 2024 targeted financial institutions and their customers, according to arecent report by cybersecurity and content delivery vendor Akamai. Information obtained via counterfeit banking sites allows cybercriminals to either loot online accounts or sell stolen banking credentials through underground marketplaces. Credentials for e-wallets and cryptocurrency accounts can be sold on the dark web for anywhere from US$120 to US$400. The high payoff of such schemes makes financial services prime targets of both brand abuse and phishing attacks. Introducing stronger identity verification and multifactor authentication (MFA) can reduce exposure to phishing attack. Introducing technologies to guard against email fraud and spoofing is also beneficial. “Organizations should deploy email authentication protocols such as Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance [DMARC] protection to prevent cybercriminals from spoofing their identity and reduce the risk of email fraud associated with their brand,” advises Matt Cooke, cybersecurity strategist at email security experts Proofpoint. Financial organizations rely on high availability, soDDoS attackspose a severe threat. The finance industry faces significant threats from hacktivist groups who target financial institutions — perceived as symbols of economic power — with DDoS attacks to advance political or social agendas, creating inconvenience and financial loss while drawing public attention to their causes. DDoS attacks are often driven by geopolitical tensions, including the Israel-Hamas conflict and the war in Ukraine. For example, a recent politically motivated DDoS attack in Julytargeted a major financial services company in Israel, originating from a globally distributed botnet, and lasted nearly 24 hours, peaking at 798Gbps. The global financial services industry was more frequently targeted by DDoS attacks than any other business sector in the first half of 2024, according to Akamai. The issue is far from limited to conflict zones. In the first half of 2024, insurance agencies and brokerages were among thetop 10 most targeted sectorsby cybercriminals in EMEA, according to network performance management vendor NetScout. “Critical infrastructure sectors, particularly banking and financial services, have experienced a 55% increase in DDoS attack activity over the last four years,” Richard Hummel, threat intelligence lead for NetScout, tells CSO. Financial institutions are frequently targeted by state-sponsored — mostly by North Korea or Iran — and other APT attackers who seek to either steal funds, manipulate the financial system, or gain intelligence. “APT groups will continue to use sophisticated tactics, including living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques, to remain undetected,” threat intel firm ReliaQuestwarns. “Securing sensitive digital assets and enhancing transaction security are critical for the sector.” North Korean state-sponsored actors, such as Lazarus, are well known for monetizing cyberattacks — most notoriously through theFebruary 2016 cyber heistof Federal Reserve Bank of New York account belonging to Bangladesh Bank. More recently North Korean cyberspies have targeted cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets to steal or launder cryptocurrency. Insider threats, often exacerbated by overprivileged access and embedded secrets, are a prominent risk in financial organizations. A disgruntled or mendacious employee with privileged access to systems and data can cause a great deal of harm. “In the finance industry, insider threats can lead to data breaches, fraud, or theft of sensitive financial information,” security vendorSentinelOne warns. The risk can be mitigated in part by managing access controls and ensuring sensitive information is accessible only to authorized personnel. Flaws that remain unfixed for longer than a year exist in 76% of organizations in the financial services sector, with 50% of organizations carrying critical security debt, according torecent research by application risk management vendor Veracode. Veracode researchers found 40% of all applications in the financial sector have security debt, marginally better than a cross-industry average of 42%. Only 5.5% of financial sector applications are flaw free. The majority (84%) of all security debt affects first-party code, but the majority (78%) of critical security debt comes from third-party dependencies. Researchers found that financial organizations fix half of first-party flaws in the first nine months, compared to 13 months for third-party flaws. Delays in fixing, or at least remediating, insecure code threaten financial sector security, according to Veracode, which warns that security debt in the financial sector is escalating rather than improving. The latest edition ofVerizon’s Data Breach Investigations Reportwarned of a 68% surge in breaches resulting fromsupply chain attacksover the past year, particularly targeting critical vendors in software, data processing, and IT infrastructure. “Supply chain cyber threats also pose a significant risk to the FSI [financial services and insurance] sector, especially with the increase in reliance on third-party IT services,” Lewis Duke, SecOps and threat intelligence lead at Trend Micro, tells CSO. Last December a ransomware attack on a service provider left 60 US credit unions facing outages. An earlier2020 supply chain attack on SolarWinds’s Orionnetwork monitoring software, widely used in government and industry, served as a wakeup call about the class of threat. “To mitigate this risk, FSI organisations must implement rigorousvendor risk management programs, and conduct thorough security assessments and audits of third-party providers,” Trend Micro’s Duke advised. Vulnerabilities in open-source components and third-party libraries are increasingly exploited in sophisticated supply chain attacks, experts warn. “SBOM [software bills of materials] automation tools scan dependencies to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle, reducing exposure to these threats,” says Philip Pearson, field CISO at cloud-native application security vendor Aqua Security. Cryptojackingoccurs when malware infiltrates an organization’s network and steals resources to mine cryptocurrency. Threat actors spread this malware through malicious websites, browser extensions, phishing emails, unsecured cloud instances, and by exploiting vulnerabilities. The scam is on the rise with security researchers reporting a 659% year-on-year rise in global cryptojacking by the end of 2023, according to SonicWall. ReliaQuest warns both financially motivated cybercriminals and nation-state-backed APT groups pose cryptojacking threats to the finance industry, which they covet for its huge computational resources. Quantum computers are advancing toward solving complex mathematical problems that underlie today’s public-key cryptography. Once operational, they could render current encryption obsolete, exposing sensitive financial data to breaches. “Quantum computers present a threat to RSA or elliptic curve-based public key encryption systems thatfinancial sector organizationsrely on to protect sensitive data,” says Dr. Marc Manzano, general manager for cybersecurity at AI and quantum technologies specialist SandboxAQ. “To mitigate this risk, financial institutions need to establish comprehensive programs to modernize cryptography management.” Fortunately, the threat has been long-anticipated and development of cryptographic algorithms secure against cryptanalytic attacks by a quantum computerhas been in the works for years. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)released its first set of quantum-resistant algorithmsin August 2024. Early adoption of these technologies aligns institutions with global best practices and regulatory expectations. The G7 Cyber Expert Group (CEG) — chaired by the US Department of the Treasury and the Bank of England — isadvising financial authorities and institutions to take proactive measures against quantum risks. Organizations should plan for aphased migration of their IT infrastructureto quantum-resistant encryption, ensuring continued data security in a post-quantum era. AI speeds up credential stuffing andbrute-force attacks, allowing cybercriminals to test passwords at a rate no human could match. Gen AI tools can also be abused to createmuch more convincing phishing scams. “The misuse of AI has stepped up phishing efforts,” according to Megha Kumar, chief product officer at global cyber consultancy CyXcel. “Forget those obvious, typo-filled scam emails. Now, cybercriminals can send highly tailored, professional-looking messages that are much more likely to trick people.” “While commercial generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, have attempted to build guardrails to prevent bad actors from using the technology for malicious purposes, adversarial tools such as WormGPT have emerged to fill the gap for attackers,” adds Keiron Holyome, VP of UKI and emerging markets at BlackBerry Cyber. Research has showngen AI can be abused to create fraudulent voice imprintscapable of circumventing biometric identification tools used by banks. That’s just the start of it. Criminals might use AI to comb through huge data sets quickly, identifying valuable targets for data theft, among other malicious applications. “Malware empowered by AI can learn typical user or network behaviors, enabling attacks or data exfiltration that evades detection by better mimicking normal activity,” Holyome says. “AI-powered reconnaissance tools may facilitate autonomous scanning of networks for vulnerabilities, choosing the most effective exploit automatically.” Not a cyber threat per se, but banks, insurance, and investment firms in particular are subject to an increasingly wide range of regulations and compliance requirements, with new cybersecurity strictures upcoming. “Failing to implement appropriate cybersecurity measures may expose [finance sector organizations] to reputational as well as enforcement risks, including severe fines under the GDPR,” warns Sarah Pearce, partner at law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth. “We are seeing an increased focus on operational resilience with upcoming legal frameworks on cybersecurity evolving and becoming more prescriptive.” DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) regulationsare set to take effect across the EU in January 2025, bringing with them a requirement for banks to establish comprehensive risk management frameworks. “Within the next year, banks will, for example, be required to comply with considerable cybersecurity obligations under DORA,” according to Pearce. “Obligations will vary depending on the specific type of products and services they offer.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT:

The 10 biggest issues CISOs and cyber teams face today,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3587231/the-10-biggest-issues-cisos-and-cyber-teams-face-today.html,"From escalating cyber threats to questions about resources and security’s role in the enterprise, cyber leaders are reshaping their agendas to address several key long-standing and emerging concerns. 1. A massively expanded threat landscape 2. Protecting a moving target — without introducing digital friction 3. An ‘avalanche of regulations’ 4. Third-party and supply chain risk 5. Increasing liability for the organization’s security 6. Securing AI within the enterprise 7. Protecting the organization from AI-enabled threats 8. Adequate resources 9. Security’s role (and stature) in the organization 10. Achieving operational excellence Related content The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time CIOs and CISOs take on NIS2: Key challenges, security opportunities Australian financial firm hit with lawsuit after massive data breach Aptori Now on Google Cloud Marketplace for AI-Powered Security and Automated Risk Remediation Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  To outsiders, the CISO role may seem straightforward: Secure the tech stack. But CISOs know that their job, which in its earliest days may have been narrow in scope, now comprises a huge array of responsibilities. AlthoughCISOs say each of those duties are critical, they cite a group of issues that are top of mind for them. Here are 10 that now dominate the CISO agenda. The volume and velocity of threats coming at organizations continue to grow, as does the sophistication of the attacks, says Jon France, CISO of ISC2, a nonprofit cybersecurity training and certification organization. “It’s the most challenging threat landscape we’ve seen in the last five years,” France adds. At the same time France says the typical organization’s attack surface has expanded, creating a much larger and more complicated environment to defend. The combination of the two — the growing threat landscape and the expanding attack surface — has CISOs “pulled across all the compass points,” he adds. CISOs must not only protect their expanding environment against an ever-increasing volume of threats but they must do so even as the environment and business needs change and change at a faster clip. “Emerging technologies is arguably the most enduring perennial issue; however, the rate of change is accelerating at an accelerating rate,” says Vandy Hamidi, CISO of BPM, an accounting and consulting firm. Moreover, Hamidi says he and other security chiefs must contend with all that rapid-fire change in ways that help the business grow and evolve; in other words, security can’t bring friction that hurts the business in the marketplace. “While I need to focus on reducing overall risk to the firm, I must also consider the effects of my decisions on our firm’s mission, our colleagues’ productivity, and our clients themselves,” Hamidi explains. To meet these modern demands, he works with his firm’s CIO “to build a strategy based on rapidly changing information. Our approach is a combination of adoption and adaption, embracing the potential while addressing the risks.” CISOs also cite as a top issue thelengthening list of regulationsthat govern their work. Niel Harper, CISO for Doodle and a board director with the IT governance association ISACA, calls it an “avalanche of regulations.” He points to the recent arrival of theNIS2 Directive in Europeand theEU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)as two recent examples of the legal demands with which CISOs must comply. “There are so many compliance requirements that now take up quite a bit of my time,” he adds. “It’s a lot of work.” The volume is just part of the issue. CISOs say they’re also contending with myriad regulations that havedifferent and sometimes even conflicting demands. They’re also dealing with regulations that vary by regions. Rex Booth, CISO of SailPoint, maker of identity and access management systems, calls it “regulation disharmony.” “All these regulations are trying to accomplish mostly the same thing — the security of products, the data being held, and the organization itself — but they ask about it and pursue it in a variety of different ways,” he says. “They’re not always at odds, but they don’t harmonize well. And that makes life difficult.” Multiple CISOs also listthird-partyandsupply chainrisk as a top concern today. “Because companies have less control over the security of their supply chain vendors, there is a vulnerability with respect to attacks on those third parties that can impact the companies that use them,” explains Jamil Farshchi, executive vice president, CISO, and CTO of Equifax. Although Farshchi says this isn’t a new area of concern, “companies are using more and more third parties and third-party software, including open source.” Meanwhile, attackers are having more success withsupply chain attacks, which — of course — has elevated supply chain security on the CISO agenda, he says, adding that CISOs are puttingmore emphasis on knowing their vendorsand the components in their software as a way to counter the threat. When the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2023charged software company SolarWinds and its CISO, Timothy G. Brown, with fraud and internal control failures, CISOs everywhere took note — as they should. It was the first time the SEC had charged a CISO. Other CISOs in recent years have facednew levels of personal liability, too, further upping the risks that professionals assume when they step into chief security roles, France says. As a result, France sees more CISOs demandingcoverage under directors and officers (D&O) liability insuranceand ensuring the authority they have in their organizations matches the legal and regulatory accountability levels they now face. CISOs are contending with artificial intelligence as much as any other executive in the C-suite, as they race tosecure the AI used within their organizations— and working to do so in ways that don’t slow their organization’s adoption of the technology. “CISOs are trying to get their arms around AI, but it’s evolving faster than they can,” says Nick Kathmann, CISO of LogicGate, a risk management and compliance solution provider. Metomic’s 2024 CISO Surveyreported that two-thirds of surveyed CISOs and IT security leaders said their top concern with generative AI is thethreat of the technology being used to create a security breach. The survey also reported than more than half of CISOs are concerned about employeesuploading sensitive business datato large language models (LLMs) — actions “that could potentially expose confidential business information and intellectual property.” Harper says CIOs and CISOs must balance security with quick AI adoption, using strategies such asstrong AI governance policiesto achieve the right equilibrium for the organization. Pam Lindemoen, CSO and vice president of strategy for the Retail & Hospitality ISAC, says the retail and hospitality industries — like many others — have seen “a massive increase in fraud and scams.” And while scams are not new, she says, “they are being supercharged by generative AI tools that fraudsters are using to create realistic content. A common scam is to post fake listings on a legitimate travel booking website or app. These listings look authentic thanks to AI-generated text and images.” Other security leaders also report worries about hackers’ use of AI to create more powerful attacks. “They’re using AI to maximize the quality and scale of traditional attacks. Social engineering, in particular, is really aided by AI. Scattered Spider used social engineering and help desk agents to breach a number of organizations, but using AI voice cloning makes it even easier to execute this attack.Add deepfakesto legacy attacks like fake CEO messages or business email compromise (or to dupe people into joining meetings with AI avatars), and the scales have massively tipped in the attacker’s favor,” Farshchi says. Although CISOs are worries about the adversaries’ use of AI, they’re also strategizing on how they can use AI to most effectively counter attacks. In fact, the Metomic survey found that four-fifths of surveyed security leaders “plan to implement AI-powered tools to fight emerging AI-based security schemes and threats.” Securing adequate resources — particularly on the talent front, but also when it comes to budget — is still a top concern for many CISOs, France says. Figures from the2024 ISC2 Cybersecurity Workforce Studyshow why: There are still too few workers to meet the workforce demand. In fact, ISC2 estimates the shortfall to be 4.8 million in 2024, with the size of the active cybersecurity workforce at 5.5 million globally while the total workforce needed is 10.2 million. The 2024 gap between available workers and demand is19% higher than it was last year. Booz Allen Hamilton CISO Amanda Cody also raises the issue, saying, “Cybersecurity is all about people. To perform the mandate of the CISO, we need to attract and cultivate teams representing a variety of skills, backgrounds, and perspectives.” Cody adds: “Finding that talent is an ongoing, perennial, and fundamental issue. We must ask ourselves: Do we have the right people in the right roles doing the right work? Are we building them up and supporting them properly? Do we have a strong pipeline of new talent coming in? To ensure we’re establishing our talent pipeline, we’ve been elevating security roles at a variety of levels across the organization. In my mind, that’s the loudest action an organization can take to demonstrate they’re invested in taking cybersecurity seriously.” Building a true, robust security culture across their organization isanother top-of-mind issuefor CISOs today — as it has been for many years, multiple sources say. It remains a top concern because many find that security remains in its own silo, treated often as an afterthought, says Theresa Lanowitz, chief evangelist for LevelBlue, a managed security service provider. Too often CTOs, CIOs, and innovation teams don’t include security at the start of projects, she explains. And many CEOs, boards, and other C-suite leaders don’t yet see security as a business-enabler or core to the company’s work. “Cybersecurity,” Lanowitz adds, “is still not part of the fabric.” Lanowitz sees improvements, however, as more organizations adopt secure-by-design principles and DevSecOps practices, and as more CISOs advocate for and landequal footing with other executives. “We’re seeing more organizations embrace security from the top down and see it as a business requirement and not just a technical problem,” Lanowitz says. In addition to all the issues that might arise one year to the next, CISOs say they continue to focus on achieving operational excellence — an always challenging and complex task. “While the basics of a cybersecurity program remain fairly constant, the protection of operations and data involves constant navigation of new technologies and dynamic threats,” Cody says. “Cybersecurity updates need to integrate seamlessly with existing systems, which requires a deep understanding, at an operational level, of the business activities you’re protecting and securing. Cybersecurity teams need to be ahead of the curve, not playing catch-up.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time CIOs

5 cybersecurity issues at stake in next week’s US election,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3593321/5-cybersecurity-issues-at-stake-in-next-weeks-us-election.html,"Experts say that, depending on who wins the presidency, Russia could gain an advantage as a digital adversary, cyber regulations could be weakened, CISA could lose power, and a US Cyber Force could emerge. Dealing with cyber adversaries: Russia could emerge stronger Foreign disinformation efforts: Letting Russia off the hook Enforcing cybersecurity regulatory requirements A CISA breakup under a Trump administration Creating a US Cyber Force as an independent armed service Related content The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time CIOs and CISOs take on NIS2: Key challenges, security opportunities Australian financial firm hit with lawsuit after massive data breach Aptori Now on Google Cloud Marketplace for AI-Powered Security and Automated Risk Remediation Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  As the US heads into a historic election, with a deadlocked electorate facing a choice between two radically different presidential candidates, several cybersecurity matters could be determined by who wins the contest on Nov. 5. Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump offer drastically different visions for the nation on many big questions, such as economic growth, healthcare, and national resilience. But some experts believe there is less divergence regarding cybersecurity than other issues. “There’s more bipartisan consensus on cybersecurity than you might think,” James Lewis, SVP and director of the technology and public policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), tells CSO. “There are a lot of shared views on what needs to be done,” Lewis says. “In talking to both camps, I’ve learned there’s more commonality than you might think.” Still, experts suggest the following five crucial cyber issues could be impacted by next week’s election results. Nation-state cyber adversaries top the list of critical issues facing the next administration and Congress, specifically Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran. The platform Harris debuted at the Democratic convention last summerbarely mentionscybersecurity but references continuation of Biden’s efforts to address cyber threats. Most experts believe Vice President Harris will likely stay that course. “Harris has what I would call the sane approach to cybersecurity,” Lewis says. “She will not be a straight-line continuation of the Biden administration, but I think we have a good idea of what her cybersecurity policies would look like.” Trump is the wild card when it comes to the big four cyber adversaries, given hiswell-known fondnessfor the authoritarian leaders of Russia, China, and North Korea. Most experts agree that for all his admiration of China’s Xi Jinping, Trump, like Harris, would be forced to counter the country’s increasingly aggressive adversarial actions in cyberspace. “I think both Republicans and Democrats seem fairly united as far as understanding that there are huge tensions with China,” David Brumley, CEO of Mayhem Security, tells CSO. “The interesting thing about China that sets it apart from Russia and North Korea is that it’s a technology hub the US depends on.” Despite his prior exchanges with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, “there’s really nothing Trump can operationalize with North Korea,” Lewis says. “What’s he going to do, say, ‘Go ahead; rob banks’?” But Trump’s closeness with Russian president Vladimir Putin could shift US policy in a more helpful direction to the Kremlin. “I think the big question is what Trump would do on Russia,” Lewis says. “What the candidates would do about Russia would be different,” Ari Schwartz, managing director of cybersecurity services at Venable, tells CSO. “There’s no question about that and what kind of pressure they would put on cyber actors, Russian cyber actors, and criminal cyber actors and how they would deal with the Russian state. Harris would continue the path we’re currently on and Trump’s a question mark regarding how he would deal with it.” Rear Admiral (Ret.) Mark Montgomery, senior director of the Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, thinks that despite Trump’s admiration for Putin, he won’t cut Russia any slack for offensive cyber operations. “I think that if someone’s doing things inappropriately in our country, they’ll be held accountable,” Montgomery says. “If Russia does bad behavior, they’ll be held accountable.” Signs are emerging that a Trump administration might look more benignly on Russia’s disinformation and election interference campaigns than a Harris administration would. For example, Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance is alreadysignalingthat he thinks Russia’s election-related disinformation efforts would not be a top concern for a Trump administration. “It’s the disinformation for which [Russia is] insidious,” Montgomery says. “This low-level spreading of false information undermines people’s belief in credible democratic processes, whether it’s the press or elections or whatever. It is more likely to happen under Trump. He’s less likely to be aggressive about addressing it.” “There’s going to be certain key issues where Republicans can point and say that we’re going to guard against disinformation, but they’re guarding against disinformation on their policy issues that they have a particular viewpoint on while letting it run rampant everywhere else,” Brumley says. “I’d hope that Democrats or someone would come in and put bigger guardrails on it.” Another potential cybersecurity differentiator is the degree to which the next administration will seek to enforce existing cybersecurity regulations or advance new ones. A Supreme Court rulingthis summer gutted the Chevron deference, which instructed courts to defer to independent regulatory agencies regarding their interpretation of Congressional statutes when issuing regulations and requirements. This decision jeopardizes all cybersecurity regulations if litigants seek to overturn them. “The Court’s decision matters more for the Democrats who actually want to do something, and so they have to find a tool that doesn’t involve legislation,” Lewis says, because getting what likely will still be a divided Congress to pass new laws that offer sufficiently detailed authorities is a virtually impossible task. “Trump doesn’t particularly want to do anything, so he’s going to be less hurt by Chevron.” “You have the push right now from the White House that they want regulatory agencies to be creative with their authorities,” Schwartz says. “Then you have the Supreme Court saying that things need to be spelled out by Congress very specifically for any regulation. I can’t imagine the Trump administration asking for large pieces of cyber legislation, regulatory cyber legislation, which the Harris administration may do.” Another cybersecurity issue at stake is the future of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s 1,000-page governing blueprint for a Trump presidency, containsmany controversial cybersecurity recommendations, including the dismantling of the Department of Homeland Security and CISA, with any CISA remnants being shifted to the Department of Transportation. Trump has vacillated between embracing Project 2025’s recommendations and distancing himself from them, but he can’t escape that the report’s primary authors are former Trump administration officials whom he likely might rehire. “I was told by a Trump person yesterday, ‘Don’t pay any attention to those [Project 2025] people,’” Lewis said. “I don’t know how much credit to give Project 2025, but they are looking at CISA. Nobody’s happy with CISA’s performance.” “That’s a big one,” Montgomery says. “What’s the role of CISA, and how will it be properly resourced. I certainly think that if the Republicans take over, CISA will have no role in disinformation. Whereas otherwise, it has a role.” “There’s a lot of distrust from Trump’s camp, and from the Republicans generally, with the FBI and CISA,” Schwartz says. “He likes the FBI even less than he likes CISA, and it’s really clear that CISA would get totally broken up.” The breakup of CISA, however, would take some time to achieve. “Under Project 2025, you need Congress to cooperate if you’re going to take it apart versus just weaken it or take steps to make sure that they’re not given any authority or any money,” Schwartz says. The final cybersecurity issue that could be determined from next week’s election is creating a US Cyber Force as an independent armed service alongside the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Space Force. “There have been a lot of people banging a pot saying, just like we have the Air Force and now we have the Space Force, we should create a Cyber Force,” Brumley says. “I would expect that if Trump is elected, that would move forward quickly. I would guess it wouldn’t happen under Democrats. I think it’s still possible, but I think it’s more like a 25% probability.” “The elections may have something to do with whether or not we have a Cyber Force. I’ve been arguing for that, and we dida paperon that, and we believe in it,” Montgomery says. “Depending on who’s elected and who in the House and Senate have leadership roles, the president will determine whether or not we move to a Cyber Force model for force generation in the military.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS The most notorious and damaging

The ability to learn on the fly and automatically adapt to changing cyberthreats gives cybersecurity teams an advantage. According to asurveyconducted by Sapio Research on behalf of Vanta, 62% of organizations plan to invest more in AI security over the next 12 months. However, some threat actors are also using machine learning and AI a toscale up their cyberattacks, evade security controls, and find new vulnerabilities all at an unprecedented pace and to devastating results. According to Bugcrowd’sannual hacker survey, released in October, 77% of hackers use AI to hack and 86% say it has fundamentally changed their approach to hacking. Today, 71% say that AI technologies show value for hacking, up from just 21% in 2023. There is generative AI tools specifically created for crime, including FraudGPT and WormGPT, according to cybersecurity firmSecureOps. “Gen AI, as well as AI more broadly, is lowering the bar in hackers’ ability to deploy and develop a series of attacks,” says Vanessa Lyon, global leader for cyber and digital risk at Boston Consulting Group. And the non-deterministic aspects of generative AI make it harder for traditional, rules-based defenses to remain relevant, she adds. In fact, according to an Octoberreportby Keeper Security, 51% of IT and security leaders say that AI-powered attacks are the most serious threat facing their organizations. Here are the ten most common ways attackers leverage AI and machine learning technologies. Defenders have been using machine learning to detect spam for decades, says Fernando Montenegro, analyst at Omdia. “Spam prevention is the best initial use case for machine learning.” If the spam filter used provides reasons for why an email message did not go through or generates a score of some kind, then the attacker can use it to modify their behavior. They’d be using the legitimate tool to make their own attacks more successful. “If you submit stuff often enough, you could reconstruct what the model was, and then you can fine-tune your attack to bypass this model,” Montenegro says. It’s not just spam filters that are vulnerable. Any security vendor that provides a score or some other output could potentially be abused, Montenegro says. “Not all of them have this problem, but if you’re not careful, they’ll have a useful output that someone can use for malicious purposes.” Attackers aren’t just using machine-learning security tools to test if their messages can get past spam filters. They’re also using machine learning to create those emails in the first place, says Adam Malone, a former EY partner. “They’re advertising the sale of these services on criminal forums. They’re using them to generate better phishing emails. To generate fake personas to drive fraud campaigns.” These services are specifically being advertised as using machine learning, and it’s probably not just marketing. “The proof is in the pudding,” Malone says. “They’re definitely better.” Machine learning allows attackers to customize the phishing emails in creative ways so that they don’t show up bulk emails and are optimized to trigger engagement and clicks.  They don’t stop at just the text of the email.AI can be used to generate realistic-looking photos, social media profiles, and other materialsto make the communication seem as legitimate as possible. Generative AI takes it up one level. According to asurveyreleased by OpenText, 45% of companies have seen an increase in phishing due to AI and  55% of senior decision-makers say their companies are at greater risk of ransomware due to the proliferation of AI use among threat actors.  Another study, by Keeper Security, found 84% of IT and security leaders say that AI tools made phishing attacks more difficult to detect. Criminals are also using machine learning to get better at guessing passwords. “We’ve seen evidence of that based on the frequency and success rates of password guessing engines,” Malone says. Criminals are building better dictionaries to hack stolen hashes. They’re also using machine learning to identify security controls, “so they can make fewer attempts and guess better passwords and increase the chances that they’ll successfully gain access to a system.” The most frightening use of artificial intelligence are the deep fake tools that can generate video or audio that is hard to distinguish from the real human. “Being able to simulate someone’s voice or face is very useful against humans,” says Montenegro. “If someone is pretending to sound like me, you might fall for it.” In fact, a couple of high-profile cases have been made public over the last couple of years in which faked audio costs companies hundreds of thousands — or millions — of dollars. “People have been getting phone calls from their boss — that were fake,” says Murat Kantarcioglu, previously professor of computer science at the University of Texas. More commonly, scammers are using AI to generate realistic-looking photos, user profiles, emails — even audio and video — to make their messages seem more believable. It’s a big business.According to the FBI, business email compromise scams led to more than $55 billion in losses over the last ten years. Even back in 2021, there weremedia reportsof a bank in Hong Kong duped into transferring $35 million to a criminal gang, because a bank official received a call from a company director with whom he’d spoken before. He recognized the voice, so he authorized the transfer. Today, hackers can make a Zoom video that’s hard to distinguish from a real person. According to asurveyby insurance company Nationwide released in late September, 52% of small business owners admit to having been fooled by a deepfake image or video, and 9 in 10 say generative AI scams are becoming more sophisticated. And large companies aren’t immune either. According to asurvey by Teleport, AI impersonation is the hardest cyberattack vector to defend against. Many popular security tools used today have some form of artificial intelligence or machine learning built in. Antivirus tools, for example, are increasingly looking beyond the basic signatures for suspicious behaviors. “Anything available online, especially open source, could be leveraged by the bad guys,” says Kantarcioglu. Attackers can use these tools, not to defend against attacks, but to tweak their malware until it can evade detection. “AI models have many blind spots,” Kantarcioglu says. “You might be able to change them by changing features of your attack, like how many packets you send, or which resources you’re attacking.” It’s not just the AI-powered security tools that attackers are using. AI is part of a lot of different technologies. Consider, for example, that users often learn to spot phishing emails by looking for grammar mistakes. AI-powered grammar checkers like Grammarly can help attackers improve their writing, while generative AI tools like ChatGPT can write convincing emails from scratch. AI and machine learning can be used for research and reconnaissance, so that attackers can look at publicly available information and their target’s traffic patterns, defenses, and potential vulnerabilities. This is where hackers always start, says Thomas Scanlon, principal researcher and technical manager in the CERT division of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. “And all of that activity is able to be done smarter and faster when it’s AI-enabled.” Many organizations don’t realize the amount of data that’s out there. And it’s not just lists of hacked passwords distributed on thedark weband social media posts by employees. For example, when companies put up a job posting or a call for proposals, they might reveal the types of technologies they use, Scanlon says. “It used to be labor intensive to gather all that data and do some analysis on it but a lot of that can be automated now.” According to the Bugcrowd hacker survey, 62% use AI to analyze data, 61% use it to automate tasks, and 38% use it to identify vulnerabilities. If an enterprise notices that it’s under attack and shuts off internet access to affected systems, then malware might not be able to connect back to its command-and-control servers for instructions. “Attackers might want to come up with an intelligent model that will stay even if they can’t directly control it, for longer persistence,” says Kantarcioglu. Now, these kinds of autonomous agents are available to anyone, thanks to commercial offerings from Microsoft, and several open-source platforms that don’t have any guardrails to keep them from being used maliciously. “In the past, the adversary would have needed human touchpoints to carry out an attack, since most attacks involve multiple steps,” says CMU’s Scanlon. “If they can deploy agents to carry out those steps, that’s definitely a looming threat — well, more than looming. It’s one of the things that AI is making real.” An attacker can trick a machine learning model by feeding it new information. “The adversary manipulates the training data set. They intentionally bias it, and the machine learns the wrong way,” says Alexey Rubtsov, senior research associate at Global Risk Institute. For example, a hijacked user account can log into a system every day at 2 a.m. to do innocuous work, making the system think that there’s nothing suspicious about working at 2 a.m. and reduce the security hoops the user has to jump through. This is similar to howMicrosoft’s Tay chatbotwas taught to be a racist in 2016. The same approach can be used to teach a system that a particular type of malware is safe or particular bot behaviors are completely normal. Legitimate software developers and penetration testers use fuzzing software to generate random sample inputs in an attempt to crash an application or find a vulnerability. The souped-up versions of this software use machine learning to generate the inputs in a more focused, organized way, prioritizing text strings most likely to cause problems. That makes thefuzzing toolsmore useful to enterprises, but also more deadly in the hands of attackers. All these techniques are a reason why basic cybersecurity hygiene such as patching, anti-phishing education and micro-segmentation continue to be vital. “And it’s one of the reasons why defense in depth is so important,” says Allie Mellen, analyst at Forrester Research. “You need to put up multiple roadblocks, not just the one thing that attackers end up using against you to their advantage.” In September, HP Wolf Securityreportedthat they’ve identified a malware campaign that was “highly likely” to have been written with the help of generative AI. “Gen AI is accelerating attacks and lowering the bar for cybercriminals to infect endpoints,” the authors say. And HP isn’t alone. According to the Vanta report, 32% of organizations surveyed are seeing a rise in AI-based malware. Researchers have even demonstrated thatgenerative AI can be used to discover zero-day vulnerabilities. And, just as legitimate developers can use AI to look for problems in their code, so can attackers, says CMU’s Scanlon. That could be open-source code available in public repositories, or code that has been obtained through other means. “Hackers can take the code and run it through ChatGPT or some other foundational model and ask it to find weaknesses in code that can be exploited,” he says, adding that he’s aware of this use for both research and nefarious purposes. In the past, only the most advanced threat actors, such as nation states, had the ability to leverage machine learning and AI for their attacks. Today, anybody can do it. What makes it particularly difficult to defend against is that AI is now evolving faster than any technology. “This is a moving target,” said Boston Consulting Group’s Lyon. “Businesses should prioritize keeping up with their level of understanding of the threat landscape and adapt skillsets.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS Generative AI red teaming: Tips

What is a DDoS attack? What is DoS What is the difference between DoS and DDoS? Common motives behind DDoS attacks How do DDoS attacks work? Types of DDoS attacks Techniques used in DDoS attacks How to identify DDoS attacks How to stop a DDoS attack Is DDoS illegal? DDoS attack examples Related content The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time Aptori Now on Google Cloud Marketplace for AI-Powered Security and Automated Risk Remediation Musk links cyberattack on X to Ukraine without evidence Suite 404: Training executives for cyberattack response in a playful way Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is when an attacker, or attackers, attempt to make it impossible for a digital service to be delivered. This could be sending a web server so many requests to serve a page that it crashes under the demand, or it could be a database being hit with a high volume of queries. The result is that available internet bandwidth, CPU, and RAM capacity becomes overwhelmed. The impact of a DDoS attack can range from a minor annoyance to an entire business being taken offline. In use for over 20 years, DDoS attacks continue to grow and evolve.Netscout reportsthat it observed over 13 million DDoS attacks in 2023 alone. Denial of service (DoS) is what it sounds like: Thwarting access to virtually anything from servers, devices, and services to networks, applications, and even specific transactions within applications. The difference between DoS and DDoS is a matter of scale. In both cases, the aim is to knock the target system offline with more requests for data than the system can handle, but in a DoS attack, one system sends the malicious data or requests, whereas a DDoS attack comes from multiple systems. Distributed attacks can cause much more damage than an attack originating from a single machine, as the defending company needs to block large numbers of IP addresses. As an attack method, DDoS is a blunt instrument. Unlike infiltration, DDoS doesn’t net an attacker any private data or control over any of the target’s infrastructure. It just knocks infrastructure offline. But in a world where having a web presence is a must for just about any business, a DDoS attack can be a destructive weapon. There are four main motives behind DDoS attacks: Taking rivals offline:The Mirai botnet, used in the DDoS attack against DNS provider Dyn, was designed as a weapon in a war among Minecraft server providers. Today, the gaming industry remains a primary target of DDoS attacks. As Netscout noted in its most recentDDoS Threat Intelligence Report: “The allure of attacking the gaming industry lies in its substantial financial value and the goal of disrupting competitors.” Geopolitics:Politically motivated groups “increasingly are using DDoS as a tool to target those ideologically opposed to them,” Netscout noted. For example, in Peru DDoS attacks spiked after nationwide protests in December. Moreover, DDoS groups are “executing attacks that seamlessly transcend national borders,” according to Netscout. The pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16), for example,targeted not just Ukraine, but countries that support Ukraine. Financial gain:While a DDoS attack isn’t aransomware attack, DDoS attackers sometimes contact their victims with a promise to turn off the firehose of packets in exchange for Bitcoins. Or, DDoS attackers may receive finanical incentives from someone who wants to take your website out. Tools called bootersand stressersare available onthe dark webthat essentially provideDDoS-as-a-serviceto interested customers, offering access to readymade botnets at the click of a button, for a price. As a diversion:DDoS attacks can also be used as a distraction to keep an organization’s limited incident response resources engaged while perpetrating a different, more stealthier attack in another part of the infrastructure simultaneously. This could lead to delays in discovering other compromises. For example, an online banking service could be hit with a DDoS to prevent users from accessing accounts, thereby delaying them from noticing that money had been transferred out of those accounts. DDoS botnets are the core of any DDoS attack. Abotnetconsists of hundreds or thousands of machines, called zombiesor bots,that a malicious hacker has control over. The attackers harvest these systems by identifying vulnerable systems they can infect withmalwarethroughphishingattacks,malvertisingattacks, and other mass infection techniques. Infected machines range from ordinary home or office PCs to IoT devices — theMirai botnetfamously marshalled an army of hacked CCTV cameras — and their owners almost certainly don’t know they’ve been compromised, as they continue to function normally in most respects. The infected machines await a remote command from a command-and-control server that is used to initiate and control the attack and is often itself a hacked machine. Once unleashed, the bots attempt to access a resource or service the victim has available online. Individually, the traffic directed by each bot would be harmless. But because there are so many of them, the requests often overwhelm the target system’s capacities — and because the bots are generally ordinary computers distributed across the internet, it can be difficult or impossible to block out their traffic without cutting off legitimate users at the same time. There are three primary classes of DDoS attacks, distinguished mainly by the type of traffic they lob at victims’ systems: Volume-based attacksuse massive amounts of bogus traffic to overwhelm a resource such as a website or server. They include ICMP, UDP, and spoofed-packet flood attacks. The size of a volume-based attack is measured in bits per second (bps). Protocol or network-layer attackssend large numbers of packets to targeted network infrastructures and infrastructure management tools. These protocol attacks include SYN floods and Smurf DDoS, among others, and their size is measured in packets per second (PPS). Application-layer attacksare conducted by flooding applications, such as web apps over HTTP/S, with maliciously crafted requests. The size of application-layer attacks is measured in requests per second (RPS). Techniques common to all types of DDoS attacks include: Spoofing:An attacker “spoofs” an IP packet when they change or obfuscate information in its header to indicate a different source IP address. Because the victim can’t see the packet’s real source, it can’t block attacks coming from that source. Reflection:An attacker may use the intended victim’s IP address as the source IP address in packets sent to third-party systems, which will then reply back to the victim. This makes it even harder for the victim to understand where the attack is coming from. Amplification:This is an extension of reflection, in which the response packets sent to the victim by the third-party systems are larger in size than the attackers’ packets that triggered the responses. This exploits certain features in protocols such as DNS, NTP, and SSDP, allowing attackers to leverage open servers on the internet to amplify the amount of traffic they can generate. All three techniques can be combined into what’s known as areflection or amplification DDoS attack, which has become increasingly common. DDoS attacks can be difficult to diagnose. Afterall, the attacks superficially resemble a flood of traffic from legitimate requests from legitimate users. But there are ways you can distinguish the artificial traffic from a DDoS attack from the more “natural” traffic you’d expect to get from real users. DDoS attack symptoms to watch for: Despite spoofing or distribution techniques, many DDoS attacks will originate from a restricted range of IP addresses or from a single country or region — perhaps a region that you don’t ordinarily see much traffic from. Similarly, you might notice that all the traffic is coming from the same kind of client, with the same OS and web browser showing up in its HTTP requests, instead of showing the diversity you’d expect from real visitors. The traffic might hammer away at a single server, network port, or web page, rather than be evenly distributed across your site. The traffic could come in regularly timed waves or patterns. Mitigating a DDoS attack is difficult because, as previously noted, some attacks take the form of web traffic of the same kind that legitimate visitors would generate. It would be easy to “stop” a DDoS attack on your website simply by blocking all HTTP requests, and indeed doing so may be necessary to keep your server from crashing. But doing that also blocks anyone else from visiting your website, which means your attackers have achieved their goals. If you can distinguish DDoS traffic from legitimate traffic as described in the previous section, that can help mitigate the attack while keeping your services at least partially online: For instance, if you know the attack traffic is coming from Eastern European sources, you can block IP addresses from that geographic region. A good preventative technique is to shut down any publicly exposed services that you aren’t using. Services that might be vulnerable to application-layer attacks can be turned off without affecting your ability to serve web pages. In general, though, the best way to mitigate against DDoS attacks is to simply have the capacity to withstand large amounts of inbound traffic. Depending on your situation, that might mean beefing up your own network, or making use of a content delivery network (CDN),a service that is designed to accommodate huge amounts of traffic and that has built-in DDoS defenses. Your network service provider might have its own mitigation services you can use, but a new strategy observed in 2024 is to keep attacks under the thresholds where the automatic traffic filtering solutions of ISPs kick in. Even smaller DDoS attacks can take down applications not designed to handle a lot of traffic, for example industrial devices exposed to the internet for remote management purposes. Yes, DDoS is illegal. Most anti-cybercrime laws, in theUS, theUK, and elsewhere, are fairly broadly drawn and criminalize any act that impairs the operation of a computer or online service, rather than specifying particular techniques. Also, the act of hacking into a computer to make it part of a botnet is itself illegal. You might see a counterargument that goes something like this: It’s not illegal to send web traffic or requests over the internet to a server, and so therefore DDoS attacks, which are just aggregating an overwhelming amount of web traffic, cannot be deemed a crime. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the law, however. Simulating a DDoS attack with the consent of the target organization for the purposes of stress-testing their network is legal, however. October 2024:Cloudflare reportedmitigating a network-layer DDoS attack that peaked at 3.8Tbps, making it the biggest DDoS attack reported to date.March 2024:A group of Russia-aligned hacktivistsdisrupted several French government serviceswith a series of DDoS attacks.

UAB CIO Gonçal Badenes on ransomware lessons learned,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3600553/how-a-university-in-barcelona-dealt-with-a-ransomware-attack.html,"In 2021, the Barcelona university was hit with an attack that knocked systems offline for two weeks, affecting 50,000 users. Here’s how preparation and partnerships served the university well in its response — and its CIO’s top takeaways from the incident. The importance of preparation Ignoring the ransom Recovery and moving forward after a ransomware attack Lessons learned Related content Report on ransomware attacks on Fortinet firewalls also reveals possible defenses The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time The state of ransomware: Fragmented but still potent despite takedowns Ransomware goes postal: US healthcare firms receive fake extortion letters Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  “Although it happened two and a half years ago, it still generates anxiety and restlessness to remember it,” is how Gonçal Badenes, CIO of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), feels about the ransomware attack carried out by the PYSA cybercriminal group in 2021 against the university. As it often happens on these occasions, the cyber incident took place over the long weekend for Spain’s National Day on 12 October. “They always act when they think you are weaker,” Badenes saidduring a presentation earlier this yearat Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. On the day it got hit with ransomware, UAB’s detection and continuity system sounded the alarms after finding that, one by one, the University’s systems were beginning crash. The personnel in charge called Badenes and UAB’s internal security committee to alert them of the situation. From that first minute, all efforts were aimed at understanding what happened, how it happened, and what must be done to recover. Here is how, despite the initial uncertainty, mammoth work, and feeling of permanent vulnerability, Badenes and his team managed not only to survive the cyberattack but build back stronger and more secure. Prior to getting hit with ransomware, the university had established a response plan that aligned with the Spanish National Security Scheme. As a result, the UAB’s team of security specialists were prepared and had developed its own methodology to address a situation of this nature before it occurred. “We knew it could happen, we had taken action on the matter; just as you do a fire drill once a year, we did the same with cybersecurity, it was a subject that we took seriously,” Badenes said. The attackers managed to encrypt the data repository of the university’s VMware virtualization platform and its backup, but the university had a second copy of the backup and another on tape. The main attack, the CIO recalled, was on the Data Processing Center, but there was a side attack on the virtual campus, where attackers deployed a PowerShell script that started encrypting user computers that were active on campus and connected to the university system. “This, I think, they did simply to increase the visibility,” he said. “The damage they did was very limited and thus ensured that both ICT staff and the student community knew what was happening.” Badenes said that at first the plan was to disconnect from the network and shut everything down to minimize the damage. However, “the magnitude of the effect that stopping everything has is difficult to imagine until you are faced with the situation.” Having gone from a mostly in-person university experience to a digital one during the pandemic, things had to be reversed to deal with the ransomware incident, which is challenging — especially when you have to inform staff and students and all systems are down. To solve this, Badenes contracted with a hosting service that created a temporary WordPress page for updates on the state of the attack, while also opening a public channel on Telegram. At this point, Badenes and his team noticed that “the internal protocols you have, however fast and structured, are too slow when the action must be immediate.” A key part of UAB’s response plan that helped tremendously was having identified, in advance, a company that could help the university in the event of an incident, Badenes said. “This meant that we did not waste hours or days that in such a circumstance are extremely valuable.” At the time, UAB worked with the Catalan Cybersecurity Agency, which joined the efforts on its own initiative, as well as the Data Protection Agency, the police, technology services provider S2Grupo, and Dell Technologies. The university believes the attack vector was made possible by phishing a student’s credential. The result of the attack was 1,200 servers and 10,000 computers were out of service and more than 50,000 users were affected. Forensics by the Catalan Cybersecurity Agency found that corporate databases remained immune; therefore, academic records, financial information, all the personal information of the corporate staff remained safe. “The amount of data leaked, in the worst case, would have been minuscule.” At this point, the question of whether to give in to the attacker’s ransom demands or stand firm was raised — adilemma all IT leaders face in such situations. Badenes and team decided to stand firm. “We neither paid nor contacted them,” he said. “We completely ignored the ransomware notes.” Badenes said the decision was made for ethical reasons and legal reasons, and “because we had no possible way of doing it as a public entity since any expense of more than €15,000 euros implies us starting a public tender process.” “I think the attackers never understood the idiosyncrasy of attacking a public entity in [Spain],” he said with some sarcasm. Having not looked at the note, Badenes wasn’t aware of the ransom the attackers wanted to decrypt the university’s data assets. “We later learned from the press that investigated it, that they were asking for a ransom of €3 million, which would be 1% of the university’s budget,” he said. The first backup had been destroyed and so was the second. It took UAB and its response partners 10 days to figure out that the third — tape — was safe. But Dell checked the encrypted backups as well and found out the second one wasn’t lost. At that point more than one sigh was heard. “The level of stress dropped considerably,” Badenes said. The next step was to restore everything that had been destroyed, but, as the CIO points out, “You have to be sure that all the systems are clean. When an attack like this occurs, it doesn’t just encrypt systems; they may also have left backdoors.” Aware of this, Badenes took the reins and strategically decided to redo critical systems from scratch: backup, identity, databases, and virtualization. “We reinstalled them from scratch,” he said. “We applied all the updates and only then did we start to dump in the data to prevent any malicious configuration from sneaking in.” Systems were down for two weeks. “The first service began to be restored 15 days after the attack; after two more weeks, the critical services for the university were all up and running,” Badenes said. “The total recovery occurred three months later, although they were relatively small things.” In October, Badenes joined CSO Spain for its Cybersecurity Forum event todiscuss UAB’s security takeaways from the incident. “Most institutions have a 24/7 service in terms of business continuity, but not in terms of security and this is a mistake,” Badenes told CSO Spain and event attendees. “The ‘business’ area never wants to stop services, but it is necessary to do so in order to apply patches and perform updates.” Badenes continued: “For example, although we had installed two-factor authentication for students to access the Office 365 platform, this was not the case for the VPN.” After the attack, UAB IT implemented 2FA in all services and renewed end-user equipment, much of which was obsolete. “In fact, the management of the user equipment, until the cyberattack was decentralized, became centralized,” he said. “Not updating computer equipment is a big risk and a possible gateway.” Another lesson learned, according to Badenes, was the importance of having different layers of security in different places, and using different technologies. For UAB, he explained, having those layers saved them from data loss. The CIO also stressed the need for public institutions to allocate more investment and resources to cybersecurity. “At the time of the cyberattack, the UAB did not have a CISO as such, but I acted as CIO and CISO of the institution,” Badenes said. This changed after the incident and UAB now has a CISO.

"What is phishing? Examples, types, and techniques",https://www.csoonline.com/article/514515/what-is-phishing-examples-types-and-techniques.html,"Phishing is a type of cyberattack that uses disguised email to trick the recipient into giving up information, downloading malware, or taking some other desired action. Phishing definition How phishing attacks work Phishing attack examples Types of phishing attacks Spear phishing Business email compromise (BEC) Whale phishing Smishing Quishing Vishing AI and phishing How to prevent phishing The history of phishing Related content Report on ransomware attacks on Fortinet firewalls also reveals possible defenses Chinese cyberespionage group deploys custom backdoors on Juniper routers Fortinet reinforces OT network security platform Polyglot files used to spread new backdoor Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  It’s the cyber pest that will not die. Three decades after phishing first emerged from the swamps of the dark web, it remains a global plague. An average of 31,000 phishing attacks were sent out per day in 2023, according toa reportby SlashNext. It’s a costly scourge: an IBM study estimated the average organization spent$4.91 millionresponding to phishing-related data breaches in 2021. Here’s a primer on how phishing works, how it originated in the 1990s, and how to prevent it. Phishing is a cyber-attack that uses email andsocial engineeringto trick a target into taking actions that will compromise their security, such as providing sensitive information or downloading malware. In a common phishing attack, the target receives an email from a source pretending to be legitimate, such as their bank, coworker, friend, or workplace IT department. The email typically asks the recipient to provide login credentials for their bank, credit card or other account by 1) replying directly to the email, or 2) clicking on a link that takes them to a website or login page. But it’s all fake, designed to scam the recipient into giving away access to sensitive accounts or networks. Alternatively, a phishing email encourages a target to click on a link or attachment that’s actually designed to downloadmalware,spywareorransomwareto their device or network. Phishing remains theprimary initial attack vector for cybersecurity incidents, according to a 2023 report from Cloudflare. More recently, Zimperium Labs found thatfour out of five phishing attacks target mobile devicesspecifically. Hackers use several methods to con their targets. Their messages often sport logos and fonts identical to those used by the brands and organizations they impersonate. Fraudsters may also use link-shortening services like Bitly to mask the URLs of malicious links in their phishing messages. Email spoofing, another popular phishing technique, involves sending messages from scam email addresses that are deliberately similar to authentic ones. “Cyber actors set up spoofed domains with slightly altered characteristics of legitimate domains. A spoofed domain may feature an alternate spelling of a word (‘electon’ instead of ‘election’) or use an alternative top-level domain such as a ‘.com’ version of a legitimate ‘.gov’ website,” the FBIwarnedin a 2020 alert. Here’s how often some of the most common phishing techniques were deployed in 2023, according to areportby Cloudflare Inc. Malicious link: 35.6% identity deception: 14.2% credential harvester: 5.9% brand impersonation: 5.4% (Microsoft was the most impersonated brand) malicious attachment: 1.9% The dark web is littered withphishing kits, ready-made bundles of key technical components needed to launch an email attack. These kits commonly include cloned versions of popular websites and fake login pages designed to steal credentials. Although phishing is deployed through digital means, it preys on very human emotions likefear, anxiety and compassion. Ironically, the following example taps into the desire of conscientious recipients to protect their DocuSign accounts from cyber threats: Christine Wong Some phishing attacks target very specific niches. This email was distributed to employees of the International Committee of the Red Cross: Christine Wong Shrewd hackers often launch phishing attacks to exploit events unfolding in real life. This fraudulent email appeal for charitable donations circulated less than 24 hours after earthquakes hit Turkey and Syria in 2023: Christine Wong Phishing has evolved into different formats and techniques over the past three decades, including the following. For more on these and other types of attacks, see “9 types of phishing attacks and how to identify them.” Spear phishingtargets one specific individual, often someone with access to an organization’s sensitive assets, such as an accountant or IT help desk employee. These emails usually contain personal information stolen from the dark web or gleaned from the target’s own social media posts. A2015 spear-phishing attacktemporarily knocked out Ukraine’s power grid. Hackers targeted certain employees of the utility with emails containing malicious attachments; that malware gave the hackers access to the grid’s IT network. Business email compromise (BEC)takesphishing to the next level. With BEC, the hacker impersonates a CEO or other top executive at a company, and then dupes an employee at that company into transferring corporate funds to a fake bank account. Sixty-eight percent of all phishing emails in 2022 were BEC attacks, according to SlashNext’s report. Per the FBI, global losses from BEC incidents reported between 2013 and 2022totaled$50.8 billion. Always keen to capitalize on current events, cyber crooks hijacked virtual meeting platforms during the pandemic, co-opting them for BEC attacks. “Criminals … [are] compromising an employer or financial director’s email, such as a CEO or CFO, and requesting employees to participate in a virtual meeting platform,” theFBI warnedin a 2022 alert. “The criminal will insert a still picture of the CEO with no audio, or deep fake audio, and claim their video/audio is not properly working. They then proceed to instruct employees to initiate transfers of funds via the virtual meeting platform chat or in a follow-up email.” An elaborateBEC hoaxcollectively cost Facebook and Google an eye-watering $100 million. Between 2013 and 2015, a scammer impersonated a board member from a real Taiwanese company. He sent phishing emails to Facebook and Google employees who regularly deal with large fund transactions, convincing them to ‘pay’ fake invoices to a fraudulent bank account. Whale phishingtargets a ‘big fish’ like a corporate CEO in order to steal a company’s funds, trade secrets or intellectual property. Smishingis phishing via SMS text message. Thirty-nine percent of all mobile phishing attacks in 2022 involved smishing, according to the SlashNext report. For more on smishing, see “Smishing and vishing: How these cyber attacks work and how to prevent them.” Quishingis phishing by QR code. The code is usually sent by email to dupe the target into downloading malware or visiting a fraudulent login page. A relatively newer form of phishing, quishing has beenon the rise dramatically, thanks in part to the use of zero-trust policies and multifactor authentication in reducing the effectiveness of phishing campaigns. Vishingis phishing by phone call or voicemail. It often employs VoIP to thwart caller ID or wardialing to deliver thousands of automated voice messages. Despite constant innovations in cybersecurity technology, some of the largest corporations on the planet have been fooled by low-tech phishing schemes. A vishing expedition shut down MGM Resorts (and its lucrative Las Vegas casinos) for more than a week in 2023. Cybercriminals monitored an MGM employee’s LinkedIn account for personal details, then used that info to impersonate him in a phone call to MGM’s help desk. The hackers persuaded help desk staff to reset the employee’s password. Ransomware was deployed, guest data were stolen, and that sham phone call cost MGM$100 million. Hackers have added artificial intelligence to their phishing arsenal. Generative AI chatbots can quickly scrape millions of data points from the internet to craft phishing emails with no factual errors, convincingly mimicking the writing style of real individuals and organizations. Singapore’s cybersecurity agencyreportedthat, in pen testing, phishing emails produced by ChatGPT “matched or exceeded the effectiveness” of those created by humans. The number of phishing emails skyrocketed by 1,265 percent in the 12 months following ChatGPT’s general availability, prompting SlashNext CEO Patrick Harr tosuggestit was “not a coincidence.” Moreover, the IBM X-Force research team reported in October 2023 that, with only five simple prompts, it was able to trick a generative AI model into developing“highly convincing” phishing emailsalmost on par with those created by skilled humans in just five minutes, potentially saving nearly two days of work for attackers. Vishing scammers can harvest samples of people’s voices from social media video clips, and then clone their voices using generative AI. ACanadian grandmalost $7,000 (CDN) when fraudsters used AI to impersonate her grandson over the phone. AI vishing has even penetrated the C-suite. The CEO of a UK energy firm received three phone calls from the firm’s parent company, asking him to transfer $243,000 (USD) to a supplier. Hedutifully sent the funds, but the voice was actually an AI replication. For individuals: If you think an email could be phishing, don’t reply, click on any links or attachments, or provide any sensitive information. Phone the organization or verify their email domain or URL by finding their website online. If an email requests a password or other sensitive information, or pressures you to take urgent action, pause and verify as noted above. Don’t post personal information on social media about your bank, birthdate, middle name, pets’ names or vacation plans. For organizations: Ensure all software and applications are set to update and patch automatically. Implement multifactor authentication and strong password policies. Deploy tools such as Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC), Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM). Regularly conduct pen testing. Continuously educate everyone in your organization about the latest phishing hazards using resources from organizations such as theSANS Institute.

Hackers may have adopted the term phishing because it sounds like fishing, a play on their goal of trawling for unsuspecting victims. The “ph” is part of a tradition of whimsical hacker spelling, and was probably influenced by the term “phreaking,” short for “phone phreaking,” an early form of hacking that involved playing sound tones into telephone handsets to get free phone calls. Some tech historians believe the term phishing dates to the 1990s when hackers used the characters — <>< — (resembling a fish) to disguise conversations about fraudulent activity in AOL chat logs.Others trace the word phishing back to 1996 when it was first mentioned by a hacker news group. Some of the first phishing took place in the early 1990s when hackers used fake screen names to pose as AOL administrators and steal sensitive information via AOL Instant Messenger. Phishing really blew up in 2000, when an email with the subject line “ILOVEYOU” duped millions of people into clicking on an attachment loaded with a virulent computer worm. In the early 2000s, hackers started impersonating sites such as PayPal by registering similar domain names for use in phishing emails. Circa the late 2000s, hackers began weaponizing personal information posted on social media sites, using it to make phishing emails seem more authentic. In the 2010s, bad actors began using malicious email attachments to spreadransomwarelike Cryptolocker and WannaCry.

6 biggest healthcare security threats,https://www.csoonline.com/article/564832/biggest-healthcare-security-threats.html,"Healthcare organizations can expect ransomware, botnets, cloud misconfigurations, web application attacks, phishing, and smart devices to be their top risks. 1. The rising ransomware threat 2. Cloud vulnerabilities and misconfigurations 3. Web application attacks 4. Bad-bot traffic 5. Increased phishing volumes 6. Smart devices Related content Report on ransomware attacks on Fortinet firewalls also reveals possible defenses The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time The state of ransomware: Fragmented but still potent despite takedowns Ransomware goes postal: US healthcare firms receive fake extortion letters Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Cyberattacks targeting the healthcare sectorhave surged since the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting rush to enable remote delivery of healthcare services. Security vendors and researchers tracking the industry have reported a major increase inphishingattacks,ransomware, web application attacks, and other threats targeting healthcare providers. This year’s rise in ransomware in healthcare, in particular theChange Healthcare breach, has been aheadline-grabbing wake-up call for healthcare execs. The trend has put enormous strain on healthcare security organizations. “The healthcare industry is under siege from a range of complex security risks,” says Terry Ray, senior vice president and fellow at Imperva. “Cybercriminals are hunting for the sensitive and valuable data that healthcare has access to, both patient data and corporate data.” Many organizations arestruggling to meet the challengebecause they are under-resourced and rely on vulnerable systems, third-party applications, and APIs to deliver services. Moreover, IT systems are increasingly used to optimize clinical encounters and patient care. For example, ambulance crews can obtain detailed medical records for patients from tablet devices on scene; the national mobilization app (NMA) in the UK is currently being introduced to modernize and standardize this across all NHS ambulance services. Implantable devices, such as loop recorders, are increasingly being used to aid diagnoses, for example, of cardiac arrhythmias. These devices support telemetry, as do wearable devices, by transmitting patient data. Important healthcare decisions are made based on this data, with patient data being far more available due to advances in IT. The increasing usage of IoT and IT in healthcare have had positive effects in terms of clinical efficiency and decision-making certainty, but it does mean greater attention to risk assessments is necessary; the past days of patient data being stored in locked filing cabinets are long gone, says WithSecure principal consultant Stuart Morgan. “The impact of patient data being manipulated or leaked is intuitive and well understood, but the risk of denial of service — whether malicious or unintended — can be huge,” Morgan tells CSO. “Although resilience is built in to these systems to a degree, resorting to backup systems are by their nature far less efficient; the inability for ambulance crews to review clinical history, patients to obtain electronic prescriptions, or clinicians at home losing access to the ambulance dispatch system have huge practical effects in the community in which they work because the general processes in place have been written on the basis that these systems are functional.” Imperva’s Ray and other security experts have identified multiple issues that present major threats to healthcare organizations today. Here are six of them. Ransomware has emerged as one of the biggest cyber threats for healthcare today. Attackers have discovered that healthcare organizations delivering life-saving treatments can be more easily extorted than victims in almost every other sector. Many healthcare organizations are also more susceptible to attacks because of new digital applications and services they have launched to address demand fortelehealth services, among other digitalization efforts. Ransomware attacks against the global healthcare sector have steadily increased since the pandemic. From 2022 to 2023, healthcare ransomware victims jumped 81%, according to astudy by US Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Security vendorSonicWall reports that 91% of malware-related healthcare breachesso far in 2024 have involved ransomware. Examples of publicly disclosed ransomware attacks against healthcare services and hospital are legion. For example, aransomware attack on Ireland’s public health systemin May 2021 forced administrators to cancel or reschedule thousands of appointments and surgeries after attackers locked some 2,000 patient-facing systems. Change Healthcare suffered a devastating ransomware attack in February 2024that disrupted insurance claim processing, prescription dispensing, and financial settlements with a huge impact to many hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies across the US. In August 2024,Michigan-based McLaren Health Care suffered the second of two ransomware attacksover the course of just 12 months. Electronic health records (EHRs) and systems present the biggest risk in healthcare today, says Caleb Barlow, president and CEO of CynergisTek. “Past attacks have shown when a hospital undergoes a ransomware-induced lockdown period, access to EHRs is shut down, and patients may have to be diverted for care,” he says. “Such attacks can prevent access to critical prescription information and dosing for patients with complex, chronic conditions like diabetes or cancer. Worse, hackers can potentially take it a step further and manipulate health record data to undermine patient care.” Historically, healthcare institutions transferred this risk to cyber insurance, but that is becoming more difficult because insurers are making it harder for organizations to purchase ransomware protection without specific controls such asmulti-factor authenticationandendpoint detection and response technologies, Barlow says. Many healthcare organizations have adopted cloud services as part of broader digital transformation initiatives, with the pandemic and associated increase in demand for remote telehealth services having accelerated that move. As a result, patient health information (PHI) and other sensitive data is increasingly being hosted in vendor cloud environments. The trend has broadened the attack surface at healthcare organizations, making them more vulnerable toattacks targeted at stealing PHI, insurance information, and other sensitive data, says Anthony James, vice president of products at Infoblox. Healthcare organizations often use multiple cloud vendors and services with different security standards and practices making it hard to apply a consistent policy for protecting data across the cloud environment, he says. Fifty-three percent of healthcare IT pros surveyed in 2021 by CyberRisk Alliance Business Intelligence on behalf of Infoblox said their organizations experienced a cloud-related data breach over the proceeding 12 months. PeakTPA, a provider of health plan management services,in March 2021 disclosedthat PHI belonging to some 50,000 Medicare and Medicaid program customers had been accessed and exfiltrated from two of its cloud servers. In another high-profile instance from 2020,sensitive databelonging to over 3.1 million patients was found lying exposed in an unprotected cloud database believed to belong to a vendor of patient management software. More than one-third (34%) of victims in the Infoblox survey described their breaches as costing them $2 million or more. Forty-seven percent said they had experienced amalwareattack targeting a cloud-hosted asset and 37% said they had experienced an insider attack involving PHI and other data stored in the cloud. More recently, 61% of healthcare companies said they experienced a cloud cyberattack in the past 12 months, with 86% of these attacks resulting in financial losses or significant damages, according to a February 2024report by healthcare software developer KMS Healthcare. Web application attacks targeting healthcare entities have spiked sharply in recent years, starting largely during the COVID pandemic when researchers from security vendorImpervaobserved a 51% increase in web application attacks on hospitals and other healthcare targets in December 2020. On average, healthcare entities experienced 498 attacks per month that year, withcross-site scripting attacksbeing the most common, followed bySQL injection, protocol manipulation attacks, and remote code execution/remote file inclusion attacks. “Technically speaking, web application attacks can be incredibly challenging for under-resourced healthcare organizations to manage,” Ray says. To address the issue, healthcare organizations must implement controls that enable better visibility into third-party applications and API connections, he says. Only then will the security team be able to understand who is trying to access critical data and whether that activity should be permitted. Web applications became the No. 1 vector for data disclosure in healthcare in 2021, according to a study by Verizon, whoseresearchwas based on analysis of 849 incidents, 571 of which involved a confirmed data disclosure. In 2024, SonicWall estimatesaround 60% of attacksslung against healthcare organizations targeted Microsoft Exchange. Traffic from bad bots — such as those that attempt to scrape data from websites, send spam, or download unwanted software — present another major challenge for healthcare organizations. The problem has become especially pressing when governments around the world began setting up new websites and other digital infrastructure to support COVID vaccine registrations and appointments. Bad actors bombarded these new, hastily established and largely untested sites with a huge volume of bad-bot traffic. Imperva says it has observed a 372% increase in bad-bot traffic on healthcare websites in the first year of the pandemic. “Increased levels of traffic result in downtime and disruption for legitimate human users who are trying to access critical services on their healthcare providers’ site,” Ray says. “It might also result in increased infrastructure costs for the organization as it tries to sustain uptime from the persistent, burdensome level of elevated traffic.” From January 2023 to June 2023, bad bots made up 30% of internet traffic, according to astudy by security vendor Barracuda. The latest 2024 edition ofImperva’s Bad Bot reportestimates malign bots account for nearly a third (32%) of internet traffic. Imperva reports that the healthcare sector has seen a rise in bad bot traffic, with 33.4% of website traffic originating from bad bots, compared to 31.7% in the previous year. Bad bots can lead to healthcare data breaches, for example throughcredential stuffingattacks against patient accounts, and scraping of sensitive health information. Cybercriminals target confidential health information, such as patient records, medical history, and insurance details because this stolen data can be sold on the dark web for profit or used for fraudulent activities, Imperva warns. Phishing attacks pose a major threat to the healthcare industry as they do in almost every sector. Again, the pandemic provided a unique backdrop for a rise in phishing volumes versus healthcare organizations. Ananalysisthat researchers at Palo Alto Network’s Unit42 team conducted recently showed an 189% increase in phishing attacks relating to or targeting pharmacies and hospitals between December 2020 and February 2021. Vaccine-related phishing attacks soared 530% over the same period. According to the vendor, in the early stages of the pandemic many phishing lures involved testing and personal protective equipment (PPE). It then shifted to stimulus and government relief programs and then to the vaccine rollout. In asurveyof 168 healthcare cybersecurity professionals conducted by Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) at the time found that phishing was the typical initial point of compromise for most security incidents. “Phishing attacks are the top type of significant security incident reported by respondents,” HIMSS noted in its report. “Phishers were the top type of threat actor responsible for significant security incidents at healthcare organizations.” Stats compiled by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) record that 18% of 4,419 reported breaches of PHI between October 2009 and the end of 2021 involved either phishing attacks or the hacking of email accounts, theHIPAA Journal reports. Phishing was the initial vector in high profile attacks against healthcare organizationsAnthem (2015)andMagellan Health (2020), among others. Astudy by BMJ, the UK medical journal, found that around 3% of emails sent to hospital staff over a one month period were suspected threats. While many staff appear to be aware of phishing and respond appropriately, ongoing education is required — particularly about the risk of leaking information of potential use to attackers through social media, the BMJ advised. Wearable and implantable smart medical devices are a proven cybersecurity risk. These technologies certainly offer better analysis, assisting diagnosis of medical conditions while aiding independent living, but mistakes made in securing such medtech have exposed vulnerable users to potential attack. A seminal moment was the lateBarnaby Jack’s hacking of an insulin pumpin 2011. This attack over Bluetooth had a maximum range of approximately 300 meters. Since then, security researchers at Pen Test Partners have found “closed loop” insulin trial data on the public internet. “In one case, we could have modified the readings taken by the body-worn continuous glucose monitor and automatically, remotely administered a fatal dose of insulin to around 3,000 users in the trial,” Ken Munro, managing director of Pen Test Partners, tells CSO. “Fortunately, the vendor involved responded very quickly to our report and had the system secured the same day.” Other connected medtech devices Pen Test Partners have found security issues with include cranial stimulators, dosing pumps, and medical robots, among many others. Fortunately, the smart devices threat has been recognised and regulators are starting to take action. For example, theUS Food & Drug Administration (FDA) introduced FD&C 524blast year to drive cybersecurity in connected medical devices.

What is the cost of a data breach?,https://www.csoonline.com/article/567697/what-is-the-cost-of-a-data-breach-3.html,"The cost of a data breach is not easy to define, but as more and more organizations fall victim to attacks and exposures, the financial repercussions are becoming clearer. Regional costs Breaches by industry What attackers chase when breaching your company Reputational damage still a big cost of being breached Severe business downtime can cost millions Regulation and litigation add to data breach costs The role of cyber insurance Organizations increasingly open to paying ransoms Insufficient security staffing leads to higher breach costs Security AI and automation Preparedness is key to managing data breach costs Related content Australian financial firm hit with lawsuit after massive data breach GitHub to unbundle Advanced Security Aptori Now on Google Cloud Marketplace for AI-Powered Security and Automated Risk Remediation Trump nominates cyber vet Sean Plankey for CISA chief amid DOGE cuts and firings Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  For modern businesses regardless of industry or size, the monetary impact of a data breach is substantial.IBM’s latest Cost of a Data Breach reportdiscovered that, from March 2023 to February 2024, the average cost of a data breach globally reached an all-time high of $4.88 million. This figure represents a 10% increase over the same period ending February 2023 and a 26.4% rise from 2018. Over the course of the past decade, data breach costs have risen 39.4%. “The report highlights trends I have been concerned about since the second half of 2023 when we started seeing organizations cut security staffing and budget,” said David Shipley, CEO and co-founder of Beauceron Security. “These are predictable outcomes of the combination of an out-of-control cybercrime wildfire combined with cutbacks both in cyber fire prevention and firefighting.” Of the 604 organizations that took part in the study, 70% experienced a significant or verysignificant disruption to businessresulting from a breach. Defenders substantially improved in the areas of mean time to identify (MTTI) and mean time to contain (MTTC), marking a 7-year low at 258 days combined — and down 7% from the previous year. This improvement was also felt in the average cost of detection and escalation, which remained relatively flat, with a 3% increase to $1.63 million. Lost business costs and post-breach response, however, increased 13.1% and 12.5%, respectively, contributing significantly to the cost increase of the average data breach overall. Leading the pack for the 14th year (and not in a good way) was the US, whose average breach cost was $9.36 million. While a 1.3% decline from 2023’s $9.48 million, it still outstripped the rest of the world by more than half a million dollars per breach. The Middle East, which considered Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for the report, was No. 2 of the 16 countries and regions surveyed, at $8.75 million, up 8.4% from 2023. It’s important to note that the number of organizations surveyed from each country can vary considerably — for example, there were 39 respondents from the Middle East and 71 from the US. Canada ($4.66 million, down 9.2%) and the UK ($4.53, up 7.6%) remain in the top 10 hardest hit, with ASEAN ($3.23 million, up 5.9%), Australia ($2.78 million, up 3%), and India ($2.35 million, up 7.8%) among the top 15. Countries whose companies saw the largest average cost increases over the past year were Italy (up 22.5% to $4.73 million), Germany (up 13.7% to $5.31 million), and Brazil (up 11.5% to $1.36 million). Healthcare remains the industry with the highest cost per breach by far, at $9.77 million, although it has made progress, shaving off 10.6% compared to 2023. It was one of four sectors out of 17 that managed to reduce its average breach cost in 2024, including research (down 2.5%), education (down 4.3%), and public sector (down 2%). Average breach cost by industry It’s probably no surprise thatpersonally identifiable information (PII)is by far the main type of data snatched during breaches. In 2024, 48% of compromised records were customer PII (down from 52%). Employee PII was second in 2023, at 40%, but dropped to third (37%) in 2024, swapping places with intellectual property (IP). Stolen IP was involved in 47% of breaches in 2024, up significantly from 34% in 2023. IP theft and loss is a consequential data breach cost, notes Glenn J. Nick, associate director at Guidehouse. The fact that it is on the rise can have major repercussions for most organizations. “Losing intellectual property can devastate a company’s growth,” Nick says. “Stolen patents, engineering designs, trade secrets, copyrights, investment plans, and other proprietary and confidential information can lead to loss of competitive advantage, loss of revenue, and lasting and potentially irreparable economic damage to the company.” Corporate data and anonymized customer data round out the top five data types stolen in 2024, which saw a new category was added: shadow data — data stored in unmanaged sources. Around one third (35%) of breaches involved shadow data. Worse, its theft, according to the report, correlated to a 16% higher cost per breach. “Researchers found storing data across environments proved to be a common storage strategy, accounting for 40% of breaches,” the report noted. “These breaches also took longer to identify and contain. In contrast, data stored in just one type of environment was breached less often, whether that environment was public cloud (25%), on premises (20%) or private cloud (15%).” “This risk of shadow data will become even more elevated in the AI era, with data serving as the foundation on which new AI-powered applications and use-cases are being built,” adds Jennifer Kady, vice president of security at IBM. “Gaining control and visibility over shadow data from a security perspective has emerged as a top priority as companies move quickly to adopt generative AI, while also ensuring security and privacy are at the forefront.” In many ways immeasurable, reputational damage remains among the most significant costs in the wake of a breach. “Ultimately, customer trust is very easy to break, and very difficult to build,” Allie Mellen, senior analyst at Forrester, tells CSO. Bob Dutile, chief commercial officer at UST, agrees: “The cost of a data breach is typically realized in relative competitive change in the marketplace. Companies find that their brand does not command the same price premium, customer conversion costs are higher, and market share is lost. For a public company, the near-term assessment of the cost impact is reflected in stock price movement.” According to Dutile, research shows that between $8 million and $10 million is a good planning number in the US for a midsize business facing a modest breach of under 250,000 records. About a third of that cost will be loss of business due to reputation damage. How a company responds to and communicates a breach can have a large bearing on that reputational impact, Forrester’s Mellen notes. “Understanding how to maintain trust with your consumers and customers is really critical here,” she adds. “There are ways to do this, especially around building transparency and using empathy, which can make a huge difference in how your customers perceive you after a breach. If you try to sweep it under the rug or hide it, then that will truly affect their trust in you far more than the breach alone.” Business downtime can be significantly costly for a breached organization, depending on the level and extent of the downtime and how technology-dependent the firm is, Jason Hicks, field CISO at Coalfire, tells CSO. “Often a breach is not going to take a company completely offline, but it can happen. The more critical systems that are taken down, the more significant the cost.” Manufacturing tends to have the best metrics around this, as it’s relatively simple to measure the cost per minute if an assembly line is down, Hicks says. “This can translate into millions of dollars a day for a large manufacturing company. This can be more nebulous for other industry verticals, but there are models to get a reasonable feel that can be applied to each vertical.” Increasingly strict data protection and privacy laws along with litigation are seeing a growing number of companies issued large fines, paying hefty settlements, and stumping up for legal fees following data breaches and non-compliance. This has played out several times recently. Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Global was fined 8.026 billion yuan ($1.19 billion) by the Cyberspace Administration of China after it decided the company violated the nation’s network security, data security, and personal information protection laws. Meanwhile, Amazon was penalized $877 million for breaches of GDPR cookie rules,T-Mobile agreed to pay $350 millionto settle a consolidated class-action lawsuit following a data breach from early 2021, andGoogle agreed to pay $60 millionin penalties for misleading Australians users about obtaining location data. “Regulated industries suffer not only the immediate cost of responding to, containing, and remediating vulnerabilities but also the long-term effects of additional penalties from their regulatory bodies and legal settlements,” Nick says. Highly regulated industries, such as healthcare and financial services, typically run one and two in order of cost per breach because they will pay more non-compliance fines than others, he adds. “Investigation and adjudication often take years for the victim organization to reach a monetary settlement with affected parties.” Legal costs are one of the largest expenditures organizations face in data breaches, Nick states. “Organizations rarely have the legal and privacy expertise in-house. To ensure compliance, they must hire outside counsel to lead their reporting.” Cyber insuranceis one way companies mitigate the cost risks of being breached. Sharp increases in the costs of cyber insurance premiumshave been stabilizing of late, but even organizations covered by insurance can expect to dole out extra cash to make good after a breach. One definite cost hit will be a hike in their insurance premiums, Guidehouse’s Nick says . “Some organizations have reported post-breach increases in premiums of approximately 200%,” he adds. Insurers are also implementing more coverage limitations, meaning that even with a policy in place, businesses could find themselves financially responsible for certain breach-related costs. In fact, Forrester’s Mellen says any notion that policies will allow organizations to fully recover financially from a cyberattack is folly. “In reality, it’s not going to cover all of the costs associated with any type of cyberattack, and we see some insurance firms not even covering ransomware at this point as part of their payouts,” she adds. Another factor to consider is that cyber insurance providers typically have a list of approved service providers such as lawyers and forensics firms, Hicks says. “If your preferred provider is not on their list, you may have to work with them to get them included, or potentially have to change providers. This can be costly, as firms are often leveraging their existing service providers to secure the maximum discounts based on the volume of work done with the partners. Also, if for some reason you can’t get them added, you could end up having to pay the costs directly versus having your insurance cover it.” Evidence suggests that companies are increasingly open to paying ransoms as part of their breach response, even setting aside millions of dollars for this purpose. “One of the first questions I often get is, ‘Should we set up a Bitcoin wallet to prepare for having to pay ransom?’” Mellen tells CSO. “At the end of the day, a ransomware attack can be an existential event for a company if their backups are not in a secure place or are not up to date, so they 100% do prepare for the reality of having to pay the ransom.” [ Related: “To pay or not to pay: CISOs weigh in on the ransomware dilemma” ] Threat actors look to determine the amount a business might be prepared to pay to continue operations. Data from ExtraHop indicates that 83% of businesses affected by ransomware in 2022 chose to pay a ransom at least once. Involving law enforcement in response to a ransomware attack can impact the overall cost of a breach, according to the survey. In 2024, 52% of ransomware victims called in law enforcement, and of those, 63% avoided paying a ransom. They also ended up saving almost $1 million (excluding any ransom paid) compared to those who did not involve law enforcement, with breach costs of $4.38 million ($4.64 million in 2023). The average cost of a breach without law enforcement involvement in 2024 was $5.37 million ($5.11 million in 2023). Law enforcement involvement also sped up the identification and containment of a ransomware attack, cutting it from 297 to 281 days on average. According to IBM’s latest report, the security skills shortage is one of the biggest data breach cost amplifiers, with the average additional cost of data breach due to cyber skills shortage pegged at $1.76 million. With a 26.2% year-over-year increase in cyber skills shortages, escalating data breach costs should be expected in the future. If insufficient security staff equates to greater data breach costs, organizations should heed Mellen’s warning about the impact a poorly handled data breach can have on employees. “If they don’t feel like the organization is able to protect them or customers in the event of a breach, or that they blame their employees for a breach, then they’re likely going to start looking for jobs elsewhere because it creates a bit of a hostile environment for them,” she says. “It is very important for organizations to recognize that they need to accept responsibility and protect both their employees and their customers.” Among factors that can help decrease the cost of a data breach, IBM cites employee training No. 1, reducing the average cost by around $260,000. In the face of staff and skills shortages, CISOs are increasingly turning to AI and automation to close the gap. According to IBM’s latest report, the average cost saving per breach for organizations using security AI and automation tools was $2.22 million, up from $1.76 million in 2023. “While data breach costs have continued to rise over the majority of the history of this report, we’ve also seen adoption and investment in key security technologies and approaches improving,” IBM’s Kady says. “More and more organizations are adopting AI and automation-based security approaches focused on speeding response times — which is one of the top factors linked to reducing data breach costs.” Other technologies and techniques that have an impact in reducing the cost of a data breach, according to the report, include, in descending order of impact:security information and event management (SIEM);incident response planning; encryption;threat intelligence;identity access management (IAM);security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR); andendpoint detection and response (EDR) tools. No matter the specific costs involved, experts agree that preparedness is key to mitigating the financial repercussions of a breach. “Faster incident response continues to be a clear driver for lowering the cost of a breach,” UST’s Dutile says. “The worst losses are those that go undetected for an extended time or have a slow or ineffective response.” Modern cybersecurity requires a post-breach mindset which understands that, eventually, a successful data breach is going to occur, Forrester’s Mellen adds. “Operating under those conditions, you need to figure out how you’re going to handle that and build your resiliency to respond better and faster. This isn’t just about the security function either, and it needs to be spread across an organization, considering what marketing is going to do, what sales is going to do, etc. — how, as a business, you can demonstrate you value your customers and that you want to make it right as quickly and effectively as possible,” she says.

Russian group’s hack of Texas water system underscores critical OT cyber threats,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3568804/russian-groups-hack-of-texas-water-system-underscores-critical-ot-cyber-threats.html,"Cyberattacks on water systems are rising, with Russian state-linked “hacktivists” posting videos of seemingly amateur intrusions. But their prank-like nature belies more malicious possibilities, as a recent attack on the small Texas town of Stanton, reported here for the first time, illustrates. Water security under threat The Cyber Army’s intrusion into small-town Texas Could these kinds of hacks threaten public safety? Why are hackers doing this? Steps CISOs and OT security professionals can take to minimize risk Related content The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time Aptori Now on Google Cloud Marketplace for AI-Powered Security and Automated Risk Remediation Trump nominates cyber vet Sean Plankey for CISA chief amid DOGE cuts and firings Suite 404: Training executives for cyberattack response in a playful way Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Cybersecurity threats to water utilitieshave accelerated in 2024 as Iranian, Chinese, and Russian threat actors increasingly target these critical systems. A spate of apparent joy-riding intrusions of rural water systems by could-be Russian state-linked hacktivists has continued unabated this year. Experts say these attacks, undertaken primarily by young amateurs, have caused little serious harm. But, they add, if experienced OT hackers took the reins, havoc could be wreaked on any number of the nearly 52,000 local water and irrigation systems in the US and other water facilities around the globe. One recent water system intrusion in Stanton, Texas, population 2,700, reported here for the first time, illustrates how vulnerabilities in under-resourced water facilities — the lowest-hanging fruit in the OT security space — must be addressed quickly. It may seem unlikely that such isolated and seemingly unimpressive assets could attract nation-state-level threat actors looking to send a message or gain hacking experience. But security specialists warn that these attacks, even if merely proving grounds, show that all critical infrastructure, no matter how small or remote, should maintain hard separations between OT and IT assets and use multifactor authentication where separations are impossible to help prevent even opportunistic attacks. The first-known hacking incident to cause real-world damage to a critical infrastructure facility involved a water facility in 2000, when a disgruntled contractorlaunchedan attack against Maroochy Water Services in Queensland, Australia, causing 800,000 tons of raw sewage to leak into the community. Since then, a major cyberattack was attempted on Israel’swater infrastructurein 2020; an attemptedwater systempoisoning in Oldsmar, Fla., that turned out to behuman errorsparked panic among policymakers and cybersecurity leaders in 2021; the US Environmental Protection Agency proposed cybersecurity regulations in 2023 for drinking water systems, which wererescinded; and US federal authorities warned that CyberAv3ngers, an Iranian Government Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)- affiliated threat group, was targeting water and wastewater systems across the country late last year. But water systems have been increasingly in the crosshairs in 2024, resulting in the following noteworthy water security developments: January 2024:CISA, the FBI, and the EPA issuedan incident response guidethat spells out best practices and federal resources for the water and wastewater sector to deal with cyber incidents. February 2024:CISA, NSA, and the FBIcalled outChinese threat group Volt Typhoon for compromising the critical infrastructure of multiple organizations, including water and wastewater systems. April 2024:“Hacktivist” group Cyber Army of Russia, aka Cyber Army of Russia Reborn,which may be linkedto Russian GRU threat group Sandworm,released videosshowing how they manipulated human-machine interfaces (HMIs) for water utility control systems in Texas towns Abernathy and Muleshoe. Earlier videos showed the group attempting to sabotage a wastewater facility in a small Polish village in January 2023. April 2024:According to a video published byLe Monde, the Cyber Army of Russia accessed the control system for a small water mill in a French village in April 2024 and made false claims to have raised a dam’s water level and shut off the electricity it produced. April 2024:The Cyber Army of Russia posted a video on its Telegram channelclaimingresponsibility for an attack on Indiana’s Tipton West Wastewater Treatment Plant. Sept. 18, 2024:The US EPAissued guidanceon improving cybersecurity for drinking water and wastewater systems. Sept. 20, 2024:The Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center (WaterISAC), a nonprofit that helps protect water utilities from physical and cyber threats,issueda TLP:AMBER threat advisory warning of Russian-linked threat actors targeting the water sector. Sept. 25, 2024:The City of Arkansas, Kansas, reported a cyber incidentinvolvingits water treatment facility. Russian-speaking threat group Z-Pentest (likely connected to the Cyber Army of Russia) took credit via a video on itsTelegram channel. Sept. 25, 2024: CISAwarnedthat threat actors, including pro-Russian hacktivists, were actively exploiting internet-accessible OT and industrial control systems (ICS) devices, including those in the wastewater and water sectors. Oct. 3, 2024:American Water, a regulated public utility that provides water and wastewater services to around 1,700 communities in 14 states, serving approximately 14 million people,experiencedwhat appeared to be an attack that primarily affected internet-facing assets, such as its customer portal. Its water and wastewater services remained unaffected. Ron Fabela, an ICS cybersecurity engineer and strategic advisor at Xona, recently unearthedanother videoof a not-before-reported intrusion of a US water system in the small town of Stanton, Texas, by the Cyber Army of Russia. The group posted the video on its Telegram channel on Aug. 30. The video shows an HMI that enables the water company to remotely establish operational levels for various components, including filtration, water turbidity or clarity, water flow rates, and more. Despite the potential linkage to Russia’s Sandworm group, Fabela thinks that, based on the video, the group mainly comprises young amateurs who don’t know what they’re doing. “They are kids,” he tells CSO. “Just half the time, when they post videos of themselves hacking a water utility, it’s not even like they’re looking to get money. They’re doing it for fun and credibility in their circles.” According to Fabela, the video shows the hackers randomly adjusting settings until they think they’ve caused something to happen. “They spend three minutes randomly clicking, then they’ll put in some numbers and try it. They don’t know what they’re doing. So, they do this over and over and over until something happens.” Jessie Montez, Stanton’s city manager, tells CSO that the hackers did have an impact fiddling with the settings. “What they did is just waste raw water,” he says. “They opened up some valves and were able to waste some untreated water.” Montez agrees with Fabela that the hackers were likely young. “My guess is that they were just showing everyone that they can do it. They were having a little fun with it, I guess.” For Montez, the group’s hack was no big deal. “I like to say it was an easy, quick fix,” which the town assigned to the systems integrator used for the water supply, Strata Innovative Solutions. How Strata fixed the situation is unclear; the lead Strata engineer assigned to the case didn’t respond to an interview request. (Montez also worked with CISA and the FBI when the agencies contacted him following a report to CISA from Fabela.) Even if the Cyber Army of Russia and otherwater utilityattackers are amateurish, experts say their activities could threaten public safety in the small towns they target. Gus Serino, founder of cybersecurity firm I&C Secure and a former staffer at a water utility, tells CSO that the access the hackers gained in the videos could, in more knowledgeable hands, cause serious problems. “We’re seeing these low-hanging fruit, easy stuff being compromised, and then the actors will post a video of them clicking away, not really in any intelligent way, but they do cause impacts,” he says. “They cause overflowed tanks and things like that.” But, he adds, “with the level of access that they have once they get access to these systems, they could do far worse if they have the capability.” Tim Erlin, security strategist at Wallarm, thinks these kinds of hackers could cause damage but discounts the malicious intent of threat actors who publicize their activities the way the Cyber Army of Russia and others have done. “I’m always suspicious of the motives when attackers claim or publicize responsibility,” he tells CSO. OT security expert Patrick Miller, CEO of Ampyx Cyber, says water systems are easy targets because they are “so under-resourced and underfunded.” Still, it’s difficult for malicious actors to cause serious problems. “It’s not easy to cause a significant impact in a water system because they are engineered to prevent this at the physical level,” he says. Some ICS experts think the hackers’ motives for infiltrating water systems and posting videos of their intrusions extend beyond having fun. “It’s an attempt to intimidate, project power, and sow distrust of the system,” Miller says. “The only other possible M.O. I see is that they are cranky about our support for Ukraine, and this is a way to give us the finger.” The possible geopolitical connection to these hacks contradicts the notion that the Cyber Army of Russia and other Russian threat groups are merely amusing themselves. Erlin thinks the hackers may be showing off their skills to get jobs as official Russian state hackers. “If you want to get hired for a job, you might want to demonstrate that you’re capable of doing that job,” he says. “And so, if these groups are not arms of the Russian government but would like to work for the Russian government, that may be who the message is for. Let’s compromise something interesting, claim responsibility for it, and gain some notoriety that might get us future paid opportunities from other employers.” Serino says his threat intelligence colleagues take it a step further. “I am not a threat intelligence person,” he says. “But I have colleagues who are, and they’re surmising that Sandworm is encouraging and feeding this. [Sandworm and the hacktivists] are not part of the same team, but there may be a piece of wire between those two groups.” In the absence of regulations enforcing cybersecurity requirements on water systems, there are some steps OT security professionals and CISOs, who are increasingly responsible for OT systems, can take to minimize water system intrusions. Given the often-hidden nature of water system assets sprawled across mostly unpopulated areas, the first step is to realize that these assets could be attractive targets. Fabela thinks water asset owners must shake off a small-town mentality. They often think, “Why would anyone else want to access this and do something malicious?” he says. “It’s just like living in a small town and leaving your front door unlocked because who would possibly want to come through my front door and steal something? I know everyone in town. Then they’re surprised when people from out of town come in and smash-and-grab a few houses in a row,” he says. Connectivity to the internet is the ultimate concern. Water utilities often connect assets to the internet to make it easier to deal with issues remotely rather than asking a technician, if one even exists, to drive for hours to check out a problem. Serino says, “Stanton, Texas, is probably like, ‘Who the heck is going to harm us, this tiny little water utility?’ But guess what? You’re sitting on the internet. You’re findable, and you have this vulnerability. Now, you’re just as likely to be a victim as anybody else. And that’s where we’re at and how this is happening.” Miller likewise thinks there should be a “very hard and tightly restricted separation” between OT and IT technologies in these environments. But if those hard boundaries are not feasible, mandatory multifactor authentication is a must. Finally, “practice incident response like your job depends on it,” he says.

The ransomware negotiation playbook adds new chapters,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3568817/the-ransomware-negotiation-playbook-adds-new-chapters.html,"Regulatory tangle has further complicated the fraught ransomware negotiation process, while new threats from increasingly unreliable attackers tactics leave organizations confronting difficult choices and moral dilemmas. Ransomware negotiation playbook The data leakage threat The sanctions tightrope Evolving ransomware negotiation landscape Related content Report on ransomware attacks on Fortinet firewalls also reveals possible defenses The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time GitHub to unbundle Advanced Security Aptori Now on Google Cloud Marketplace for AI-Powered Security and Automated Risk Remediation Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  When an organization is suddenly locked out of its own systems or has sensitive data stolen, it’s not just about losing access — it’s an existential threat to its entire operation. Navigating a ransomware attack requires a cross-departmental response team, including legal counsel, cybersecurity experts, and organizational leadership. The technical team’s role during a ransomware attack involves securing unaffected systems, identifying the ransomware strain, and beginning data recovery processes from backups, if available. Meanwhile, the legal team evaluates the implications of engaging with the attackers, considering both the immediate and long-term legal ramifications, while coordinating with law enforcement agencies, regulators, and cyber insurers. “When a ransomware attack hits, the initial response is critical,” Ian Nicholson, incident response head at Pentest People tells CSO. “The legal and technical teams must assess the damage. They identify the type of ransomware, the extent of the data breach, and the potential impact on the organization’s operations.” One area where the full cross-departmental response team plays a key role is in answering the critical question: Should you pay the attacker’s ransom demand, and if so, how should those negotiations play out? There’s a long-running debate about whether it’s ethical to pay attackers since this perpetuates the cycle of attacks. But this has to bemeasured against the imperative for restoring operationseven if that means meeting the extortionate demands of criminals. CSO spoke to several industry experts who urged victims not to engage with increasingly unreliable attackers much less meet their extortionate demands, while others in incident response still saw value in at least talking to cybercriminals. Following is an aggregate of their advice on ransomware negotiations, as both a dilemma and vital incident response practice. When engaging with threat actors, specialized negotiators, often from external companies such as incident response firms, take the lead in communicating with the attackers. Their primary goals are to gather intelligence, understand the attackers’ demands, and negotiate terms. Professional negotiators can often achieve better outcomes than organizations trying to negotiate themselves because specialists have more expertise in dealing with ransomware groups. “Engaging in negotiations can be beneficial for several reasons,” according to Pentest People’s Nicholson. “Firstly, it buys time for the business to implement other recovery measures or gather more information about the attackers. Secondly, it provides valuable intelligence on the attackers’ methods, intentions, and the data they have compromised.” Time spent duringransomware negotiationsgives cybersecurity experts more scope to identify vulnerabilities, stop the spread of the attack, and evaluate backup options — as well as offering an opportunity to gather intelligence about the attacker’s methods and intentions. Engagement is typically done under the cover of anonymity — it is customary to create a persona, an employee of the company — and to communicate over encrypted channels specified by the attacker. “Sometimes, during these exchanges, attackers inadvertently reveal information that helps security teams understand the scope of the breach or the type of data that was accessed,” Ramzy Ladah, a trial attorney, tells CSO. “This can be invaluable, both for managing the immediate crisis and for future prevention.” Skilled negotiators can reduce ransom demands and verify that a decryption key works before finalizing a deal. Incident response firm GuidePoint Security is tracking around 70 ransomware groups, mostly from Eastern Europe but some from Iran, North Korea, and China. Some will settle for 50% of the original asking price while others are more inflexible and will offer discounts up to only 20%, according to Mark Lance of GuidePoint Security. Threat actors need to uphold a reputation for delivering on what they promise if victims pay — something that’s still the case to a large extent even in an environment where gangs frequently close down and rebrand, according to Lance. Another aspect of ransomware negotiation is addressing the threat of data leakage. Attackers often use this as leverage, threatening to publish or sell sensitive information unless their demands are met. Many ransomware groups now employ a double extortion tactic, threatening to leak stolen data unless their demands are met. “This adds significant pressure on the victim to comply with the attackers’ demands,” Nicholson notes. Pentest People is noticing a trend of more attackers simply stealing and extorting the victim for the data without deploying any ransomware. “The organization has to consider the potential fallout of having private data leaked,” according to trial attorney Ladah. “This could mean compliance violations, damage to reputation, and liability to third parties whose data might have been compromised.” More recently some data leakage threats have become more personal. Bernard Montel, EMEA technical director and security strategist at Tenable, tells CSO: “Hackers are not only exfiltrating company data, but they are targeting VIPs to exfiltrate specific information such as emails, personal data, financial information, etc., owned by high-profile individuals, in order to create pressure on them individually as well as the company.” This negotiation pressure technique is appearing in more ransomware attacks, along with an approach of wiping instead of encrypting data, according to Montel. Throughout this negotiation process, the legal team ensures that all actions comply with relevant laws and regulations, especially if the attackers are linked to sanctioned entities, including ransomware groups linked to Russia. Recently, there’s been more government scrutiny around paying ransoms, especially when the attacker is tied to a sanctioned entity. For example, the US Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control has issued advisories indicating thatpaying ransoms to sanctioned individuals or groups can lead to severe legal repercussions, including substantial fines and potential criminal charges. No such charges have ever been brought, according to industry experts quizzed by CSO, but the risk nonetheless exists. “If a victim organization ends up negotiating with a group that’s been flagged by government agencies, it opens up the risk of penalties and legal action against the victim itself,” according to Ladah. “In these cases, the organization’s legal team must liaise with law enforcement right away.” Ladah continues: “Doing so can sometimes provide a degree of legal protection or, at the very least, create a paper trail that shows the organization acted in good faith and under advisement. It’s not a get-out-of-jail-free card, but it can help mitigate some of the legal risks.” Elsewhere,Australia’s Cyber Security (Ransomware Payments) Regulations 2023 require ransom payments to be reported to authoritieswithin 72 hours. Similar regulations are likely to follow in Europe, where authorities are taking an increasingly dim view of ransomware payments. Sarah Pearce, a partner at global law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth, warns: “Generally speaking, law enforcement in the UK/EU does not encourage the payment of ransom demands and the UK NCSC [National Cyber Security Centre] website for example, identifies some key risks.” Paying for a decryption key is “unlikely to result in an immediate return to business as usual, particularly for large organisations,” theUK’s NCSC warns. “Running a decryption key across complex networks can take time. If a victim organisation has access to both backups and a decryptor, it may prove quicker to use backups,” the UK government cyber-assurance agency adds. TheUK Cyber Security and Resilience Billproposed by the new government is said to include provisions mandating increased incident reporting to give government better data on cyberattacks, including where a company has been held to ransom, Pearce adds. Europe has already introduced mandatory reporting obligations for ransomware incidents, at least in the case of larger organizations or providers of critical services. For example, the EU’s Network and Information Security Directive, now NIS2, mandates the prompt reporting of cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks, to regulatory authorities. How ransomware negotiations work in practice was illustrated during apresentation by threat analysts from Fox-IT (part of NCC Group) at Black Hat Europe 2021. Alejandro Rivas-Vásquez, global head of digital forensics and incident response at global cybersecurity company NCC Group, tells CSO that the ransomware negotiation playbook has changed in the three years since that presentation, largely to the detriment of victimized organizations. “Since 2021, ransomware negotiations have evolved significantly,” according to Rivas-Vásquez. “Global efforts to limit payments and increase cyber incident reporting have limited the negotiating power of victim organizations.” The rise of double (encryption and data leak threat) and triple extortion (involving potentialDDoS attacks) tactics complicates the negotiation process. The result is attackers not only encrypt data but also threaten to leak sensitive information or pressure third parties, forcing organizations to balance reputational risks with operational disruptions. “Trust in negotiations is eroding,” Rivas-Vásquez tells CSO. “Enforcement actions against major ransomware-as-a-service operations revealed that many attackers failed to delete stolen data even after ransoms were paid.” Many countries are promoting international cooperation and intelligence sharing as well as applying scrutiny to third-party cryptocurrency payments agents. “With governments cracking down on payments, rising distrust in attackers’ promises, and increased maturity in corporate responses, paying ransoms has become a less viable and riskier option for many organizations,” Rivas-Vásquez concluded. Put bluntly: Paying ransoms may encourage further attacks and doesn’t guarantee data recovery. Websites such asNo-More-Ransomoffer a lifeline to businesses that have suffered a ransomware attack, but prevention and hardening systems and procedures is beforehand always preferable to dealing with the heightened risk of a potential breach. “Incident response and preparedness can play a key role in recovery from an incident such as a ransomware attack,” Pentest People’s Nicholson says. “By detailing and testing responses, organizations can better understand what their specific pain points are and fill any security gaps to reduce the risk.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT:

"What is pretexting? Definition, examples, and attacks",https://www.csoonline.com/article/569453/what-is-pretexting-definition-examples-and-prevention.html,"Pretexting is a social engineering attack that employs a fabricated scenario and character impersonation to win trust and gain access to data and accounts under false pretexts. Pretexting definition Anatomy of a pretexting attack How pretexting works Pretexting examples Pretexting and phishing Tailgating attack Pretexting law How to prevent pretexting Related content GitHub to unbundle Advanced Security Aptori Now on Google Cloud Marketplace for AI-Powered Security and Automated Risk Remediation Trump nominates cyber vet Sean Plankey for CISA chief amid DOGE cuts and firings CISA cybersecurity workforce faces cuts amid shifting US strategy Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Pretextingis form ofsocial engineeringin which an attacker fabricates a story to convince a victim to give up valuable information or access to a service or system. The distinguishing feature of a pretexting attack is that the scammer comes up with a story — or pretext— to fool the victim. The pretext generally aims to cast the attacker as someone in a position of authority who has the right to access the information sought, or who can use the information to help the victim. Pretexting has a long history; tabloid journalists for years have used pretexting in the UK, where it’s also known as blagging,to get access to dirt on celebrities and politicians. But today, pretexting is commonly used to target private individuals and companies to get access to financial accounts and private data. To achieve their ends, pretexters will use any form of communication, including emails, texts, and voice calls. InSocial Engineering Penetration Testing,security engineer Gavin Watsonlays out the techniques that underlie every act of pretexting: “The key part … [is] the creation of a scenario, which is the pretext used to engage the victim. The pretext sets the scene for the attack along with the characters and the plot. It is the foundation on which many other techniques are performed to achieve the overall objectives.” There are two main elements to a pretext: a character, played by the scam artist; and a plausible situation, in which the character needs or has a right to specific information. For instance, because errors can arise with automatic payment systems, it’s plausible that a recurring bill payment we’ve set up might mysteriously fail, prompting the company we owe to reach out as a result. An attacker taking on the character of a helpful customer service rep reaching out to help us fix the error might ask for bank or credit card information as the scenario plays out to gain the information necessary to steal money from our accounts. The key to pretexting success is ensuring the victim believes the attacker is who they say they are. It’s not enough for the victim to find the character and scenario plausible; they must trust the attacker actually is, for example, a customer service rep from their cable company. To do so, pretext attackers must: Conduct researchon their targeted victims, gathering information that could be leveraged in their scenario. For example, an attacker might go through someone’s garbage to obtain their cable bill to know the name of their cable provider and their account number when calling their intended victim to make their character and scenario more believable. Develop a scenariothat is not only plausible but also tailored to their intended victim, crafting it in a way that justifies their need for the information they seek. Build trustwith their targeted victim whileestablishing authorityto receive the targeted information. This is where the confidence game is played out, building rapport and using psychological tactics to encourage intended victims to let down their guards and go along with the mapped-out scenario. Execute the requestonce they are confident their intended victim will pass along the sensitive data or enable the access that they seek, without incurring suspicion. Collect the goodsby leveraging the data or access obtained from the victim, whether this involves completing a simple transaction or launching another series of attacks privileged by the information or access achieved via pretexting. Calling further attention to the first step, the more specific the information a pretexter knows about you before they get in touch with you, the more valuable the information they can convince you to give up. That’s whycareful researchis foundational for pretexters, who have a wealth of efficient research techniques available to them, including so-called “open source intelligence” — information that can be pieced together from publicly available information, ranging from government records to LinkedIn profiles. Gigabytes of personally identifying data is also available on thedark webdue to innumerable data breaches. This data can be purchased at relatively low prices to serve as a skeleton for pretexting scenarios. Pretexters can also add plausibility to their scenarios using other techniques. For instance, they canspoofthe phone number or email domain name of the institution they’re impersonating to make themselves seem legit. One of the first ways pretexting came to the world’s notice was through a series of scandals involving British tabloids in the mid-2000s. These papers, desperate for even minor scoops on celebrities and royals, used various techniques to snoop on victims’ voicemail. In some cases, this involved dumpster diving, testing to see whether victims employed default voicemail PINs (a surprising number did), and bluffing phone company customer service reps to allow access to voicemail boxes. Many Americans’ first introduction to pretexting came in 2006, when internal strife at Hewlett-Packard boiled over into open scandal. HP’s management hired private investigators to find out whether board members had leaked information to the press. In doing so, the PIsimpersonated those board members, in some cases using their Social Security numbers, which HP had provided, to trick phone companies into handing over call records. The whole thing ended with HP’s chairwoman Patricia Dunn resigning in disgrace and criminal charges being filed. Outside the celebrity and corporate realm, the KnowBe4 blog gives a great example of how a pretexting scammermanaged to defeat two-factor authentication to hack into a victim’s bank account. The victim was supposed to confirm with a six-digit code, texted to him by his bank, if he ever tried to reset his username and password; the scammers called him while they were resetting this information, pretending to be his bank confirming unusual charges, and asked him to read the codes that the bank was sending him, claiming they needed them to confirm his identity. With those codes in hand, they were able to easily hack into his account. Pretexters are more likely to target companies than individuals, because companies generally have larger bank accounts. It’s hard to find details of successful attacks, as companies aren’t likely to admit they’ve been scammed. VTRAC’s Chris Tappin and Simon Ezard, writing for CSO Australia, describe a pretexting technique they call the Spiked Punch, in which the scammers impersonate a vendor that a company sends payments to regularly. Using information gleaned from public sources and social media profiles, they can convince accounts payable personnel at the target company to change the bank account information for vendors in their files, and manage to snag quite a bit of cash before anyone realizes. In another example, Ubiquiti Networks, a manufacturer of networking equipment,lost nearly $40 million dollarsdue to an impersonation scam. The pretexters sent messages to Ubiquiti employees pretending to be corporate executives and requested millions of dollars be sent to various bank accounts; one of the techniques used was “lookalike URLs” — the scammers had registered a URL that was only one letter different from Ubiquiti’s and sent their emails from that domain. Spoofing an email address is a key part ofphishing, and many phishing attempts are built around pretexting scenarios; for instance, an attacker could email an HR rep with attachedmalwaredesigned look like a job-seeker’s resume. The targeted variety of phishing, known asspear phishing, which aims to snare a specific high-value victim, generally leads to a pretexting attack, in which a high-level executive is tricked into believing that they’re communicating with someone else in the company or at a partner company, with the ultimate goal being to convince the victim to make a large transfer of money. (Deepfakes are starting to be seen used in this capacity.) Pretexting is also a key part ofvishing— a portmanteau of “voice” and “phishing” that involves, in essence, phishing over the phone. Many pretexters get their victim’s phone number as part of an aforementioned online collection of personally identifying information and use the rest of the victim’s data to weave the plausible scenario that will help them reach their goal (generally, a crucial password or financial account number). Often lumped under the heading pretexting, tailgating is a common technique for getting through a locked door by simply following someone who can open it inside before it closes. It can be considered pretexting because the tailgater often adopts a persona that encourages the person with the key to let them into the building — for instance, by wearing a jumpsuit and claiming they’re there to fix the plumbing, or by carrying a pizza box they say must be delivered to another floor. Like many social engineering techniques, this one relies on people’s innate desire to be helpful or friendly; as long as there’s some seemingly good reason to let someone in, people tend to do it rather than confront the tailgater. Pretexting is, by and large, illegal in the United States. For financial institutions covered by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) — which is to say just about all financial institutions — it’s illegal for any person toobtain or attempt to obtain, to attempt to disclose or cause to disclose, customer information of a financial institution by false pretenses or deception. GLBA-regulated institutions are also required to put standards in place to educate their own staff to recognize pretexting attempts. One thing the HP scandal revealed, however, was that it wasn’t clear if it was illegal to use pretexting to gain non-financial information — remember, HP was going after their directors’ phone records, not their money. Prosecutors had topick and choose among laws to file charges under, some of which weren’t tailored with this kind of scenario in mind. In the wake of the scandal, Congress quicklypassed the Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act of 2006, which extended protection to records held by telecom companies. One of the best ways to prevent pretexting is to simply be aware that it’s a possibility, and that techniques like email or phone spoofing can make it unclear who’s reaching out to contact you. Any security awareness training at the corporate level should include information on pretexting scams. (As noted, if your company is an American financial institution, these kinds of trainings are required by law.) And to avoid situations like Ubiquiti’s, there should be strong internal checks and balances when it comes to large money transfers, with multiple executives needing to be consulted to sign off of them. On a personal level, it’s important to be particularly wary whenever anyone who has initiated contact with you begins asking for personal information. Remember, your bank already knows everything it needs to know about you — they shouldn’t need you to tell them your account number. If you’re suspicious about a conversation with an institution, hang up and call their publicly available phone number or write to an email address from their website. Finally, if a pizza guy tries to follow you inside your office building, tell them to call the person who ordered it to let them in. Don’t worry: if they’re legit, they’ve got a special box that will keep the pizza warm for the few extra minutes it’ll take to deliver it.

Reconnaissance Resource development Initial access ML model access Execution Persistence Privilege escalation Defense evasion Credential access Discovery Collection ML staging attack Exfiltration Impact Related content CIOs and CISOs take on NIS2: Key challenges, security opportunities Generative AI red teaming: Tips and techniques for putting LLMs to the test Trump nominates cyber vet Sean Plankey for CISA chief amid DOGE cuts and firings The state of ransomware: Fragmented but still potent despite takedowns Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  It’s one thing to understand that artificial intelligence introduces new and rapidly evolving threats, but it’s quite another — incredibly daunting — task to stay on top of what those threats look like, where they’re coming from, and how severe they are. The Adversarial Threat Landscape for AI Systems (ATLAS) is an attempt to do just that, so you don’t have to. Developed by the nonprofit technology research organization MITRE and modeled after its widely popular MITRE ATT&CK repository, ATLAS is a “living knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world attack observations and realistic demonstrations from AI Red Teams and Security Groups”. MITRE recommends using ATLAS for activities such as security analysis, AI development and implementation, threat assessments, and red-teaming and reporting attacks on AI-enabled systems. The ATLAS flows from left to right and demonstrates an attack lifecycle from initial reconnaissance through ultimate impact. MITRE MITRE     Reconnaissance activities will often involve searching for publicly available research materials from victims. This may include examples such as journals and conference proceedings, preprint repositories, or technical blogs. The process matches that of attackers who may also look for publicly available adversarial vulnerability analysis. This can include information on vulnerabilities in models, services/providers, platforms and underlying technologies and helps inform successful AI-focused attacks, whether using known exploitation techniques or creating new ones. After attackers have conducted their reconnaissance, they look to establish resources they can use for their malicious activities. This includes activities such as creating and purchasing resources to support their activities or compromising and stealing existing resources which may offer both cost savings and make their activities opaque and hard to attribute. We see this quite often with cloud infrastructure more recently, but historically activities such asbotnetsas well forDDoStype attacks. This tactic in ATLAS involves seven different techniques. For the sake of brevity, we won’t cover them all but they include things such as: Acquiring public ML artifacts Obtaining/developing capabilities Acquiring infrastructure Poisoning data and publishing poisoned datasets Techniques in this tactic not only involve traditional resources but also look to craft adversarial data, create proxy machine learning models, and publish poisoned datasets publicly, similar to the way in which attackers take advantage of theopen-source ecosystem by poisoning software packages. Once an attacker has done their reconnaissance and is developing resources for their malicious activity, they will seek to gain initial access to the AI/ML system, typically via networks, mobile devices, edge systems or a combination of them. The systems may also be local to the enterprise or be hosted in a cloud environment or managed service provider. There are many ways attackers can establish initial access to a system. Some examples ATLAS gives include: ML supply chain compromise Valid accounts App exploitation LLM prompt injection Phishing Model evasion While some of these techniques are common in other cyberattacks, some are more novel for AI/ML, such as compromising the ML supply chain through GPU hardware, data, and ML software or even the model itself. Model evasion is a technique that involves the attacker craftingadversarial dataand inputs to the ML model that can cause a desired effect on a target model. LLMprompt injectionhas been perhaps one of the most discussed attack types against generative AI and LLM systems. It involves crafting malicious prompts to input to the LLM to get it to act in unintended ways. A unique technique in attacking AI/ML systems is ML model access. Attackers are often seeking access to the ML model to gain information, develop attack techniques, or input malicious data into the model for nefarious purposes. They can also get access to the model through various paths, such as the underlying hosting environment, via an API, or by interacting directly with it. Techniques involved in ML model access include: ML model inference API access ML-enabled product or service Physical environment access Full ML model access Organizations are increasingly utilizing ML and AI in their products and services, either directly through an AI provider or direct integration of ML and AI into their product portfolio. Attackers may look to get access to the underlying ML model through these products and services, or even glean insights from logs and metadata. Now we’re starting to have the rubber hit the road, as the attacker looks towards execution. This involves looking to run malicious code within the ML artifacts or software, either locally or on a remote system. It also aids broader activities, from moving laterally the stealing of sensitive data. There are three potential techniques involved in this tactic: User execution Command and scripting interpreter LLM plugin compromise Execution may involve the user taking specific actions, such as executing unsafe code through techniques such as social engineering or attachments. Attackers may also use commands and scripting to embed initial access payloads or help establish command and control. Once an initial foothold has been established through execution, attackers are striving to establish persistence. This often occurs through ML artifacts and software and is aimed at helping the attacker keep access beyond system restarts or credential rotations that would normally eliminate their access. The techniques cited for persistence include: Poison training data Backdoor ML model LLM prompt injection Persistence, of course is a common facet of cyberattacks, but the method in which the attacker establishes it for AI/ML systems can be unique. This may involve poisoning datasets the ML model uses or its underlying training data and labels to embed vulnerabilities or inserting code which can be triggered later when needed, such as a backdoor. Gaining initial access and persistence are key but often an attacker wants to escalate their privilege to achieve an intended impact, whether it is full organizational compromise, impacting models or data, or exfiltration of data. Attackers typically take advantage of system weaknesses, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities to escalate their level of access. The three techniques ATLAS identifies include: LLM prompt injection LLM plugin compromise LLM jailbreak Given that we have discussed the first two techniques several times already, we will focus on the LLM jailbreak. An LLM Jailbreak includes using a prompt injection to put the LLM into a state that lets it freely respond to any user input, disregarding constraints, controls, and guardrails the LLM system owner may have put in place. Getting access to a system and persisting achieves much for the attacker but detection could lead to the elimination of access or severely impacting an attacker’s goals, making defensive evasion is key. Similar to previous tactics, the techniques involved here include: Evading ML model LLM prompt injection LLM jailbreak This may aid in activities such as evading ML-based virus and malware detection or network scanning to ensure their activities are not discovered. It should be no surprise to see credential access and compromise listed. While ATLAS lists account names and passwords, this should be expanded to any sort of credentials, including access tokens, API keys, GitHub Privileged Access Tokens and more, as credential compromise remains a leading attack vector and we see the rise of non-human identities (NHI) as well, due to APIs, microservices, cloud, and the current digital landscape. The only technique ATLAS lists under credential access is: Unsecured Credentials They discuss insecurely stored credentials such as plaintext files, environment variables, and repositories. Discovery is similar to reconnaissance, but this takes place within your environment, rather than on the outside. The attacker has established access and persistence and is now looking to gain insights about the system, network, and ML environment. The four techniques listed include: Discover ML model ontology Discover ML model family Discover ML artifacts LLM meta prompt extraction Here attackers are looking to understand the ML model, its ontology, the family of models it belongs to, how it responds to inputs, and more to tailor their attacks accordingly. They also are looking to understand how an LLM handles instructions and its internal workings so it can be manipulated or forced to disclose sensitive data. In this phase of the attack lifecycle according to ATLAS, the attacker is gathering ML artifacts and other information to aid in their goals. This often is a precursor to stealing the ML artifacts or using the collected information for next steps in their attacks. Attackers are often collecting information from software repos, container and model registries and more. The techniques identified are: ML artifact collection Data from information repositories Data from local systems Now that information has been collected, bad actors start to stage the attack with knowledge of the target systems. They may be training proxy models, poisoning the target model, or crafting adversarial data to feed into the target model. The four techniques identified include: Create proxy ML model Backdoor ML model Verify attack Craft adversarial data Proxy ML Models can be used to simulate attacks and do so offline while the attackers hone their technique and desired outcomes. They can also use offline copies of target models to verify the success of an attack without raising the suspicion of the victim organization. After all the steps discussed, attackers are getting to what they really care about — exfiltration. This includes stealing ML artifacts or other information about the ML system. It may be intellectual property, financial information, PHI or other sensitive data depending on the use case of the model and ML systems involved. The techniques associated with exfiltration include: Exfiltration via ML inference API Exfiltration via cyber means LLM meta prompt extraction LLM data leakage These all involve exfiltrating data, whether through an API, traditional cyber methods (e.g.ATT&CK exfiltration), or using prompts to get the LLM to leak sensitive data, such as private user data, proprietary organizational data, and training data, which may include personal information. This has been one of the leading concerns around LLM usage by security practitioners as organizations rapidly adopt them. Unlike exfiltration, the impact stage is where the attackers create havoc or damage, potentially causing interruptions, eroding confidence, or even destroying ML systems and data. In this stage, that could include targeting availability (through ransom, for example) or maliciously damaging integrity. This tactic has six techniques, which include: Evading ML models Denial of ML service Spamming ML systems with chaff data Eroding ML model integrity Cost harvesting External harms While we have discussed some of the techniques as part of other tactics, there are some unique ones here related to impact. For example, denial of an ML service is looking to exhaust resources or flood systems with requests to degrade or shut down services. While most modern enterprise grade AI offerings are hosted in the cloud with elastic compute, they still can run into DDoS and resource exhaustion, as well as cost implications if not properly mitigated, impacting both the provider and the consumers. Additionally, attackers may look to erode the ML model’s integrity instead with adversarial data inputs that impact ML model consumer trust and cause the model provider or organization to fix system and performance issues to address integrity concerns. Lastly, attackers may look to cause external harms, such as abusing the access they obtained to impact the victim system, resources, and organization in ways such as related to financial and reputational harm, impact users or broader societal harm depending on the usage and implications of the ML system.

INCIBE demonstrates value of ransomware simulation,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3537220/incibe-demonstrates-value-of-ransomware-simulation.html,"The Spanish cyber institute presented to the press an example of its red-team exercises, which it uses not only to prepare its teams for real threats but also to educate Spanish companies the importance of preparing theirs. Visibility exercise Related content Report on ransomware attacks on Fortinet firewalls also reveals possible defenses The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time The state of ransomware: Fragmented but still potent despite takedowns Suite 404: Training executives for cyberattack response in a playful way Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  In León last week, the Spanish National Cybersecurity Institute (INCIBE) hosted a live demonstration of its capabilities for detecting, mitigating, and responding to cyber incidents. INCIBE, which operates under the Ministry of Digital Transformation and Civil Service through the State Secretariat for Digitalization and Artificial Intelligence, invited CSO Spain to observe the high-impact simulation, which was aimed at training personnel and testing and improving the security of its information systems and digital services. “It is very important for every organization to be trained and educated so that when they are suffering a cyberattack they know how to act,” Patricia Alonso, manager of INCIBE, told CSO Spain. As Alonso pointed out, it’s one thing to know there are crisis procedures; it’s another thing to be able to put them through their paces. “When an incident happens, we get nervous, we don’t remember, or we don’t know what to do. It is very important to be clear about the procedure to follow and to practice it,” she said. INCIBE. “If a company is trained, it will have no problems knowing what to do at all times or how to communicate what has happened,” she added. “And that means, among other advantages, having a faster recovery.” The exercise presented by INCIBE involvedred-teaming, in which part of the organization, the red team, plays the role of an attacker to test and help improve the security practices of those participating in the defense, the blue team. As cybercriminals, INCIBE’s red team re-created an advanced attack and realistic crisis scenario, in which it exploited a vulnerability in INCIBE’s systems and managed to launch, using intrusion techniques, aransomware attackon the infrastructure that supports the services managed by Incibe. The simulation allowed INCIBE’s expert cybersecurity protection teams to test and improve the procedures used in all phases of managing a cyber incident — preparation, identification, containment, mitigation, recovery, and post-incident action. Patricia Alonso, manager of INCIBE INCIBE. “At INCIBE we have to lead by example, and the simulation has been just that: to show how an attacked company responds, in this case ours. To do this we have chosen ransomware,as it is the incident that most people are likely to be aware of at the moment; and because it is the one that most companies report to us,” Alonso said. “We have to be prepared for a cyberattack of this type, and what we wanted to check is whether we suffered from any type of vulnerability that could be exploited by attackers. Luckily, that was not the case. In addition, we also wanted to test our recovery and contingency systems,” she added. For information purposes, INCIBE has offered annual simulation sessions to more than 160 strategic Spanish companies through its CyberEx program. To this end, it has provided the necessary tools to train them in responding to security incidents. This year, the institute expects 30 new companies to join this initiative, thus expanding the network of organizations prepared to face cyber threats. Likewise, INCIBE stressed the importance of coordination with the competent authorities and other response teams as key elements in the detection and mitigation of cyberattacks. During the simulation, response actions, the activation of contingency services, and the recovery of services in production were demonstrated. “One of the aspects that we wanted to highlight with this cyber exercise was the holding of a videoconference to check that all the teams were constantly connected. Our crisis committee, in which the management committee participates, was also represented in this videoconference,” Alonso said. “And it is very important that they do so because they have to know what the consequences of not making investments in cybersecurity are; and, in the event that a service has been affected, this incident has to be reported to the backup center. That is why it has been so important to have the means of communication, so that citizens know what to do in the event of suffering a cyberattack,” she said.

Cyber insurance price hikes stabilize as insurers expect more from CISOs,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3537205/cyber-insurance-price-hikes-stabilize-as-insurers-expect-more-from-cisos.html,"Ransomware-driven premium spikes of the past few years appear to be leveling off, while EU regulations encourage more businesses to consider coverage. Risk mitigation in an era of escalating cyber incident costs Cyber insurance policies evolve Regional differences on cyber insurance Regulations also driving cyber insurance uptake CISO liability becomes a factor Related content Report on ransomware attacks on Fortinet firewalls also reveals possible defenses The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time Chinese cyberespionage group deploys custom backdoors on Juniper routers Fortinet reinforces OT network security platform Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Cyber insurance costs have stabilized over the past year following a period of rate hikes driven in large part by increased ransomware attacks. During the past few years, insurance payouts exceeded 70% of premiums, resulting in an unsustainable business environment for cyber insurers. Insurers responded to the burden of higher claims by raising premiums far above inflation levels, while imposing stricter underwriting requirements and, in some cases, coverage limitations. As a result,insurance premiums rose 50% in 2022, according to Fitch Ratings, and whilecosts continue to rise, the increments CISOs are encountering for cyber insurance have slowed of late. “We’re now seeing a decline in ransomware incidents and payments, which is helping to stabilize costs,” says Michael Robert, a cybersecurity specialist at GTA Bloom. Insurers’ strict underwriting requirements and their insistence on better cyber hygiene practices from potential clients have also played a role in stabilizing the market, industry experts report. “Now that we have passed the hard market, we are able to offset some of the need for rate and lessen the coverage limitations, as we’ve seen cybersecurity posture improve across most industries and revenue bands,” Emma Fekkas, regional vice president of underwriting at Cowbell Insurance, tells CSO. “While strict underwriting requirements have not really changed, we are seeing better cybersecurity hygiene in companies seeking cyber insurance,” she adds. Cyber insuranceis a specialized form of insurance designed to protect businesses from financial losses and liabilities arising from the effects ofransomwareor other forms of cyberattack and data breaches. Policies typically cover business interruption losses due to cyberattacks, the cost of recovering systems, legal fees, infosec consultant charges, the cost of notifying customers, and even (in some cases) ransomware payments — themselves still acontentious topic in among CISOs. And the costs associated to data breaches continue to rise. According to research from IBM, theaverage cost of a data breachjumped by 10% this past year, to US$4.88 million. Ransomware has, by far, been the leading cause of cyber insurance losses, according to acyber insurance trends report by insurer Munich Re, which notes that manufacturing has been the sector with the highest number of ransomware claims. Zscaler Threat Labs’ 2024 Ransomware report confirmsmanufacturing is the most targeted industryfor ransomware, followed by healthcare, technology, and education. A2024 study by Chainalysisshowed that ransom crypto payments nearly doubled in 2023 to US$1.1 billion, up from US$567 million in 2022. Other costly attack vectors were business email compromise (BEC) and supply chain attacks. Businesses typically need to demonstrate strong cybersecurity practices to get cyber insurance coverage, and these baselines have been elevated as cyber events become more frequent and costly. Keith Povey, security evangelist at enterprise security monitoring tools vendor Panaseer, tells CSO: “Insurers have had their fingers burnt on big payouts and are asking for more assurances from customers — some won’t even give a quote unless companies can prove a certain baseline of security.” Moreover, ransomware attacks have changed the market by pushing insurers to implement stricter underwriting processes, according to James Harrison, global head of insurance at commercial data analytics firm Dun & Bradstreet. “Many insurance policies no longer offer full coverage for ransomware events, instead capping coverage for ransom payments,” Harrison says. “Data-driven risk assessments are now a key tool for insurers, allowing them to identify cyber vulnerabilities within businesses. This means personalized policies can be adapted to a company’s specific risk exposure.” Overall, the global cyber insurance market reached US$14 billion in 2023 and is estimated by Munich Re to further double to US$29 billion by 2027. Still, regional differences in prevalence of coverage and regulatory and legal contexts remain. For example, according to data presented at the Zywave conference in London earlier this year, the number of companies insured against cybersecurity risk was estimated to be 20% in the US, 12% in Germany, and 10% in the UK. That US cyber insurance figure is bigger because of the great maturity of the market there, as well as the greater risk US companies face from class-action lawsuits arising from data breaches than their European counterparts, observers say. “There has been a much higher uptake of cyber insurance in the US than in Europe,” according to Claud Bilbao, UK regional vice president of sales and distribution at Cowbell Insurance. “This has been driven by a number of key factors, most notably the differences around approach to litigation and legal risk, the regulatory environment, cyber awareness, as well as insurance market maturity.” Rick Betterley, author of The Betterley Report and an expert who has researched cyber insurance since 2000, adds that US corporate insurance advisers are more proactive when it comes to selling cyber insurance coverage. “I suspect a broker in the US is more worried about getting sued by a client for not informing the client about cyber risk and insurance than in other countries,” Betterley, president of Betterley Risk Consultants, tells CSO. Both US and European cyber insurance markets are expected to continue growing as cyber threats increase and awareness of risk management through insurance becomes more widespread. “The US cyber insurance market is larger, more mature, and characterized by higher uptake,” says Cowbell’s Bilbao. “In contrast, Europe’s market is developing, with GDPR being a key driver of growth, but with slower uptake due to less perceived risk and lower market maturity.” Another factor that may impact regional differences is that large companies sometimes need to contract with more than one cyber-insurance provider to cover their desired liability. With cyber insurance more prevalent in the US, this may mean more policies in play among its larger enterprises. “A larger company may wish to buy higher limits than any single insurer will offer,” Betterley says. “So in order to achieve the desired limits they might buy a base limit (i.e., $25 million) and layer another limit (say, $10 million) on top of that for a total of $35 million. Large companies in the US often buy several hundred million dollars of limits.” Regulation, and in particular the expansion of the NIS2 framework, are key factors driving the expansion of cyber insurance in Europe. NIS2(Network and Information Systems Directive 2) comes into effect in October 2024, expanding the scope of sectors and entities covered by the EU-wide regulation. NIS2 imposes stricter cybersecurity requirements and risk management measures on organizations in 15 critical sectors instead of the previous seven and places a greater emphasis on security supply chains and the overall security of suppliers. More businesses, many of them small to midsize, in multiple sectors across Europe will need to comply with the directive. Organizations may turn to cyber insurance to help manage the financial risks associated with potential non-compliance or security incidents covered by NIS2. Moreover, cyber insurance providers often offer risk management services that can help organizations improve their security maturity. “If a company follows a cybersecurity framework, such as NIS2, there are processes an organization needs to put in place to comply — for example, crisis management, incident response, forensic services, etc. — as preparation for a potential cyber incident,” Tony Anscombe, chief security evangelist at ESET, tells CSO. “These services or skill sets are not necessarily something you have to hand in operational teams, but they are typically provided by cyber insurers as part of the policy,” Anscombe says. Any regulation that requires information disclosure — including but not limited to NIS2 andGDPRas well as US regulations such as theCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act— or that require incident response create a rationale for companies to invest in cyber insurance as part of their plans to improve their overall cybersecurity maturity. Other experts agree that regulations play a big role in motivating CISOs to buy cyber insurance. “Regulations that impose costly response obligations on the breached organization make for a compelling reason to buy insurance”, Betterley says. Most larger companies follow a framework or standard, such asISO 27001, for risk management. When companies follow a framework, they are naturally developing more mature security architecture and policies, making them easier to insure. “If a company does not follow a framework, they may be required by the insurer to implement additional protection and respond to any concerns the insurer highlights,” ESET’s Anscombe says. Recent US federal legislation and regulatory enforcement from the SEC has putCISOs in the firing line, facing the threat of legal action if their organizations’ actual security posture fails to match the assurances reported to investors. “This has increased jeopardy, and cyber insurance is evolving to encompass individuals as well as their employers,” according to Panaseer’s Povey. “Many CISOs are now considering personal indemnity insurance and asking for it as part of their contract so they’re covered in the event of a lawsuit”. Doubts remain about whether CISOs are protected by employers only as long as they work for them, or for life. “We’re approaching a scenario where CISOs could leave their company and then face a lawsuit from their ex-employer for security failings,” Povey warned.

Enterprises regularly remind users to beware ofphishing attacks, but many users don’t really know how to recognize them. And humans tend to be bad at recognizing scams. According toProofpoint’s 2024 State of the Phishreport, more than 70% of employees admit to risky behavior that leaves them vulnerable. This speaks to both the sophistication of attackers and the need for equally sophisticated security awareness training,which many companies fail to adequately provide. Add in the fact that not all phishing scams work the same way — some are generic email blasts while others are carefully crafted to target a very specific type of person — and it gets harder to train users to know when a message is suspect. Let’s look at the different types of phishing attacks and how to recognize them. The most common form of phishing is the general, mass-mailed type, where someone sends an email pretending to be someone else and tries to trick the recipient into doing something, usually logging in to a website or downloading malware. Attacks frequently rely on email spoofing, where the email header — the from field — is forged to make the message appear as if it were sent by a trusted sender. But phishing attacks don’t always look like a UPS delivery notification email, a warning message from PayPal about passwords expiring, or an Office 365 email about storage quotas. Some attacks are crafted to specifically target organizations and individuals, and others rely on methods other than email. And with generative AI on the rise, phishing attempts aregetting more “highly convincing” and can be created more quickly, suggesting the old ways of scamming are receiving new life. Phishing attacks get their name from the notion that fraudsters are fishing for random victims by using spoofed or fraudulent email as bait.Spear phishingattacks extend the fishing analogy as attackers are specifically targeting high-value victims and organizations. Instead of trying to get banking credentials for 1,000 consumers, the attacker may find it more lucrative to target a handful of businesses. A nation-state attacker may target an employee working for another government agency, or a government official, to steal state secrets. For example, Iranian cyberespionage group APT42 is known for using sophisticated spear-phishing techniques that involveimpersonating multiple organizations and individualsthat are known or of interest to their victims. Spear phishing attacks are extremely successful because the attackers spend a lot of time crafting information specific to the recipient, such as referencing a conference the recipient may have just attended or sending a malicious attachment where the filename references a topic the recipient is interested in. In a 2017 phishing campaign,Group 74 (aka Sofact, APT28, Fancy Bear) targeted cybersecurity professionalswith an email pretending to be related to the Cyber Conflict US conference, an event organized by the United States Military Academy’s Army Cyber Institute, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Military Academy, and the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. While CyCon is a real conference, the attachment was actually a document containing a malicious Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro that would download and execute reconnaissance malware called Seduploader. Different victims, different paydays. A phishing attack specifically targeting an enterprise’s top executives is called whaling, as the victim is considered to be high-value, and the stolen information will be more valuable than what a regular employee may offer. The account credentials belonging to a CEO will open more doors than an entry-level employee. The goal is to steal data, employee information, and cash. Whaling also requires additional research because the attacker needs to know who the intended victim communicates with and the kind of discussions they have. Examples include references to customer complaints, legal subpoenas, or even a problem in the executive suite. Attackers typically start withsocial engineeringto gather information about the victim and the company before crafting the phishing message that will be used in the whaling attack. Aside from mass-distributed general phishing campaigns, criminals target key individuals in finance and accounting departments viabusiness email compromise (BEC)scams and CEO email fraud. By impersonating financial officers and CEOs, these criminals attempt to trick victims into initiating money transfers into unauthorized accounts. Typically, attackers compromise the email account of a senior executive or financial officer by exploiting an existing infection or via a spear phishing attack. The attacker lurks and monitors the executive’s email activity for a period of time to learn about processes and procedures within the company. The actual attack takes the form of a false email that looks like it has come from the compromised executive’s account being sent to someone who is a regular recipient. The email appears to be important and urgent, and it requests that the recipient send a wire transfer to an external or unfamiliar bank account. The money ultimately lands in the attacker’s bank account. FBI data from 2022 stated that, despite the rise of ransomware, enterprises in aggregatelose 51 times more money through BEC attacks. BEC scams have also of latetaken on new dimensions with multi-stage attacks. As such, companies must ensure they havecomprehensive BEC policy documentationto help guide employees and make them feel safer by following pre-defined rules. Clone phishing requires the attacker to create a nearly identical replica of a legitimate message to trick the victim into thinking it is real. The email is sent from an address resembling the legitimate sender, and the body of the message looks the same as a previous message. The only difference is that the attachment or the link in the message has been swapped out with a malicious one. The attacker may say something along the lines of having to resend the original, or an updated version, to explain why the victim was receiving the “same” message again. This attack is based on a previously seen, legitimate message, making it more likely that users will fall for the attack. An attacker who has already infected one user may use this technique against another person who also received the message that is being cloned. In another variation, the attacker may create a cloned website with a spoofed domain to trick the victim. Vishing stands for “voice phishing” and it entails the use of the phone. Typically, the victim receives a call with a voice message disguised as a communication from a financial institution. For instance, the message might ask the recipient to call a number and enter their account information or PIN for security or other official purposes. However, the phone number rings straight to the attacker via a voice-over-IP service. In asophisticated vishing scamin 2019, criminals called victims pretending to be Apple tech support and providing users with a number to call to resolve the “security problem.” Like the old Windows tech support scam, this scam took advantage of user fears of their devices getting hacked. AI advances are poised to make vishing a more insidious attack vector given the ability AI’s increasingly accurate ability to replicate known voices via audio deepfakes (see below). Smishing, a portmanteau of “phishing” and “SMS,” the latter being the protocol used by most phone text messaging services, is a cyberattack that uses misleading text messages to deceive victims. The goal is to trick you into believing that a message has arrived from a trusted person or organization, and then convincing you to take action that gives the attacker exploitable information (like bank account login credentials, for example) or access to your mobile device. Smishing is on the rise because people are more likely to read and respond to text messages than email:98% of text messages are read and 45% are responded to, while the equivalent numbers for email are 20% and 6%, respectively. And users are often less watchful for suspicious messages on their phones than on their computers, and their personal devices generally lack the type of security available on corporate PCs. 2022’ssmishing attack on Deakin University in Australiashows the impact these sorts of attacks can have. Snowshoeing, or “hit-and-run” spam, requires attackers to push out messages via multiple domains and IP addresses. Each IP address sends out a low volume of messages, so reputation- or volume-based spam filtering technologies can’t recognize and block malicious messages right away. Some of the messages make it to the email inboxes before the filters learn to block them. Hailstorm campaigns work the same as snowshoe, except the messages are sent out over an extremely short time span. Some hailstorm attacks end just as the anti-spam tools catch on and update the filters to block future messages, but the attackers have already moved on to the next campaign. Criminals have begun turning todeepfakes to construct more convincing phishing attacks. To do so, scammers use artificial intelligence to swap faces in videos or to impersonate voices to trick prospective marks into making corporate fraud transfers as part of businesses email compromise-style frauds. In one of the highest-profile deepfake attacks to date, a worker at design and engineering firm Arup fell victim to a sophisticated deepfake-based scam that resulted in the loss of HK$200 million ($25.6 m). The worker was initially suspicious when he received a request to carry out a secret transaction. However, the worker dismissed his doubts after attending a video call where the deepfaked “CFO” and “other employees” of the company were present, according tonews reports. Malicious actors can use an array of otherwise legitimate generative AI tools to create deepfakes from recorded speech extracts or photographs of their intended targets, according to security vendor WithSecure. For example, FaceSwap can be used to superimpose a target’s face on an attacker-created video. Similarly Microsoft’s VASA-1 framework can be abused to create deepfake video from a single portrait photo and speech audio sample, according to Tom Taylor-MacLean, a security consultant at WithSecure. Users aren’t good at understanding the impact of falling for a phishing attack. A reasonably savvy user may be able to assess the risk of clicking on a link in an email, as that could result in a malware download or follow-up scam messages asking for money. However, a naive user may think nothing would happen, or wind up with spam advertisements and pop-ups. Only the most-savvy users can estimate the potential damage from credential theft and account compromise. This risk assessment gap makes it harder for users to grasp the seriousness of recognizing malicious messages. Organizations need to consider existing internal awareness campaigns andmake sure employees are given the tools to recognizedifferent types of attacks. Organizations also need tobeef up security defenses, because some of the traditional email security tools — such as spam filters — are not enough defense against some phishing types.

Ransomware explained: How it works and how to remove it,https://www.csoonline.com/article/563507/what-is-ransomware-how-it-works-and-how-to-remove-it.html,"Ransomware is a form of malware that encrypts or blocks access to a victim’s files, data, or systems until a ransom is paid. Here’s what you need to know to avoid being a victim and what to do if you fall prey to cyber criminals. What is ransomware? Ransomware attacks are common and costly What is ransomware as a service (RaaS) How ransomware works Who is targeted for ransomware attacks? How to prevent ransomware How to remove ransomware Should you pay the ransom? Ransomware examples Related content Report on ransomware attacks on Fortinet firewalls also reveals possible defenses The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time GitHub to unbundle Advanced Security Aptori Now on Google Cloud Marketplace for AI-Powered Security and Automated Risk Remediation Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Ransomware is a form of malware that encrypts or blocks access to a victim’s files, data, or systems until a ransom is paid. When under such an attack, users are shown instructions for how to pay a fee to get the decryption key. The costs for enterprises hit with ransomware can range from hundreds to thousands to millions of dollars, payable to cybercriminals in Bitcoin. According to the Sophos State of Ransomware 2024 survey of 5,000 IT and cybersecurity leaders released in April, 59% of organizations were hit by a ransomware attack in 2023. Of those victims, 56% paid a ransom to get their data back. Exploited vulnerabilities were the most commonly identified root cause of an attack, impacting 32% of organizations. This was closely followed by compromised credentials (29%) and malicious email (23%). Ransoms being demanded and — in many cases — paid are growing. In 63% of cases the ransom demand was for $1 million or more — $4.3 million, on average. Of the 1,097 respondents who shared their payment details, the average payment was $4 million — up from $1.5 million in 2023. But attacks such asransomware attack in 2023 cost MGM Resort International casino $100 millioncan be dramatically more costly. Similarly, according to a2024 reportbyCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), ransomware continues to evolve and disrupt with “critical services, businesses, and communities worldwide, causing costly incidents that are increasingly destructive and disruptive.” According to the report, it costs businesses an average of $1.85 million to recover from a ransomware attack. Adding salt to the wound, 80% of victims who paid a ransom were targeted and victimized again by criminals, CISA reported. The economic, technical, and reputational impacts of ransomware incidents, throughout the initial disruption and, at times, extended recovery, continue to pose a challenge for organizations large and small, according to CISA. Ransomware as a service (RaaS) allows cybercriminals to offer ransomware software to other individuals or groups for a fee. While of course a criminal activity, it follows the same model as software-as-a-service, infrastructure-as-as-service, and other cloud-based services. This allows individuals with limited technical skills to launch ransomware attacks without needing to develop the malware themselves. RaaS has made it easier for cybercriminals to launch ransomware attacks, increasing the frequency and sophistication of these attacks — and ofAI is only making it easier. RaaS platforms often provide would-be criminals the following cloud-based services: RaaS providers develop and maintain services such encryption algorithms and decryption keys. RaaS platforms can help distribute the ransomware to potential victims, often through phishing campaigns or exploiting vulnerabilities in software. RaaS providers offer payment processing: services to help collect and launder ransom payments, making it difficult for law enforcement to trace the funds. Much like legitimate businesses, RaaS providers often offer customer support. There are a number of ways that ransomware can access a computer. One of the most common delivery systems isphishingspam — attachments that come to the victim in an email, masquerading as a file they should trust. Once they’re downloaded and opened, they can take over their computer, especially if they have built-insocial engineeringtools that trick users into allowing administrative access. Some other, more aggressive forms of ransomware, such asNotPetya, exploit security holes to infect computers without needing to trick users. Once it’s taken over the victim’s computer, there are several things the malware might do, but by far the most common action is to encrypt some or all of the user’s files. The Infosec Institute offers anin-depth look at how several flavors of ransomware encrypt files, but the most important thing to know is that at the end of the process, the files cannot be decrypted without a mathematical key known only by the attacker. The user is presented with a message explaining that their files are now inaccessible and will be decrypted only if the victim sends an untraceable Bitcoin payment to the attacker. In some forms of malware, the attacker mightclaim to be a law enforcement agencyshutting down the victim’s computer due to the presence of pornography or pirated software on it, and demanding the payment of a “fine,” perhaps to make victims less likely to report the attack to authorities. However, most attacks don’t bother with this pretense. There is also a variation, called leakware or doxware, in which the attacker threatens to publicize sensitive data on the victim’s hard drive unless a ransom is paid. But because finding and extracting such information is a very tricky proposition for attackers, encryption ransomware is by far the most common type. There are several ways attackerschoose the organizations they target with ransomware. Sometimes it’s a matter of opportunity: For instance, attackers might target universities because they tend to have smaller security teams and a disparate user base that does a lot of file sharing, making it easier to penetrate their defenses. On the other hand, some organizations are tempting targets because they seem more likely to pay a ransom quickly. For instance, government agencies orhealthcarefacilities often need immediate access to their files. Law firms and other organizations with sensitive data may be willing to pay to keep news of a compromise quiet — and these organizations may be uniquely sensitive to leakware attacks. But don’t feel like you’re safe if you don’t fit these categories: As noted, some ransomware spreads automatically and indiscriminately across the internet. There are a number of defensive steps you can take toprevent ransomware infection. These steps are, of course, good security practices in general, so following them improves your defenses from all sorts of attacks: Keep youroperating system patched and up-to-dateto ensure you have fewer vulnerabilities to exploit. Don’tinstall software or give it administrative privilegesunless you know exactly what it is and what it does. Installantivirus software, which detects malicious programs like ransomware as they arrive, andwhitelisting software,which prevents unauthorized applications from executing in the first place. And, of course,back up your files,frequently and automatically. That won’t stop a malware attack, but it can make the damage caused by one much less significant. If your computer has been infected with ransomware, you’ll need to regain control of your machine. CSO’s Steve Ragan has a videodemonstrating how to do this on a Windows 10 machine: The video has all the details, but the important steps are the following and read the complete article: Reboot Windows 10 tosafe mode Installantimalware software Scan the systemto find the ransomware program Restore the computerto a previous state Or read the complete article detailinghow to recover a system from a ransomware attack But here’s the important thing to keep in mind: While walking through these steps can remove the malware from your computer and restore it to your control, it won’t decrypt your files.Their transformation into unreadability has already happened and if the malware is at all sophisticated, it will be mathematically impossible for anyone to decrypt them without access to the key that the attacker holds. In fact, by removing the malware, you’ve precluded the possibility of restoring your files by paying the attackers the ransom. Whether or not to succumb to ransom demands depends partly on whether you backed up the data you have on the system that has been infected withmalware and can restore it. If you’ve lost vital data that you can’t restore from backup, should you pay the ransom? When speaking theoretically, most law enforcement agencies urge you not to pay ransomware attackers, on the logic that doing so only encourages hackers to create more ransomware. That said, many CISOs that find themselves afflicted by malware quickly stop thinking in terms of the “greater good” and start doing thecost-benefit analysis of paying or not paying, weighing the price of the ransom against the value of the encrypted data. To make the best decision, evaluate whether your data can be restored from backups and whether your cyber insurance covers operational expenses in the event of prolonged business disruption. Both would give enterprises leverage to avoid paying the ransom. To encourage victims to pay quickly before thinking too much about it, there are often discounts offered for acting fast, so as. In general, the price point is set so that it’s high enough to be worth the criminal’s while, but low enough that it’s often cheaper than what the victim would have to pay to restore their computer or reconstruct the lost data. With that in mind, some companies are beginning to build the potential need to pay ransom into their security plans: For instance, some large UK companies that are otherwise uninvolved with cryptocurrency areholding some Bitcoin in reservespecifically for ransom payments. There are a couple of things to remember, keeping in mind that the people you’re dealing with are, of course, criminals. First, what looks like ransomware may not have actually encrypted your data at all; make sure you aren’t dealing with so-called “scareware“ before you send any money to anybody. And second, paying the attackers doesn’t guarantee that you’ll get your files back. Sometimes the criminals just take the money and run, and may not have even built decryption functionality into the malware. But such malware will quickly get a reputation and won’t generate revenue. For that reason, Gary Sockrider, principal security technologist at Arbor Networks,estimates around 65% to 70% of the timethe crooks come through and your data is restored. While ransomware has technically been around since the ‘90s, it’s only taken off in the past nine years or so, largely because of the availability of untraceable payment methods like Bitcoin. Below is a list of some of the worst offenders historically as wellthe top ransomware groups to watchin 2024. LockBit,once a dominant player in the ransomware scene, its activities have been disrupted due to law enforcement actions. However, the ransomware landscape is constantly evolving, and new variants or affiliates of LockBit may still be active DragonForce, uses a leaked ransomware builder originally associated with the notorious LockBit ransomware group. RansomHub, a RaaS operation that emerged in February 2024 but quickly rose through the ranks. NCC lists it as the top ransomware group by the number of attacks observed in July. According to aCISA and FBI advisoryfrom 29 August, the group has made over 210 victims so far. APT73, refers to themselves as “APT” (Advanced Persistent Threat) followed by a number, specifically APT73, which is a ransomware group modeled on LockBit. dAn0nsurfaced at the end of April 2024 and has since posted information about 12 victims on their data leak site. Its data leak site lacks of emphasis on design or a visible logo, which may suggest that the group prioritizes attack methodologies over branding. Play, also known as Playcrypt, is not a newcomer to the ransomware scene, being around since 2022, it has taken advantage of the demise of its bigger peers, possibly attracting some of their affiliates.. Conti,another prominent ransomware group that was significantly impacted by law enforcement operations. While it may have been dismantled, its infrastructure could potentially be reused by other cybercriminal groups. Akir, appeared in April 2023 and was thought to be an offshoot of the defunct Conti group because its file encryptor shared many code. Medusa, a RaaS operation that started in late 2022 and gained prominence in 2023. The group is different from MedusaLocker, another RaaS operation that has been around since 2021. CryptoLocker, a 2013 attack, launched the modern ransomware age and infected up to 500,000 machines at its height. TeslaCrypttargeted gaming files and saw constant improvement during its reign of terror. SimpleLockerwas the first widespread ransomware attack that focused on mobile devices. 8Base, a double-extortion ransomware group that started operations in 2022, is a bit of a weird group because it displayed similarities to other data extortion gangs such as RansomHouse, prompting speculation that they might be related. BlackCat,also known as ALPHV, was the second most active ransomware group in 2022, according to cybersecurity conpany Malwarebytes. Black Basta, Another suspected Conti offshoot, is a ransomware group that first appeared in April 2022 and is believed to have targeted over 500 organizations to date, with 114 victims listed on its in 2024. BlackByte, similar to Black Basta, BlackByte is another sophisticated Conti offshoot. While this group does not stand out through the high number of publicly known victims, recent research by Cisco Talos suggests that the group is much more active than previously believed. WannaCryspread autonomously from computer to computer using EternalBlue, an exploit developed by the NSA and then stolen by hackers. NotPetyaalso used EternalBlue and may have been part of a Russian-directed cyberattack against Ukraine. Lockystarted spreading in 2016 and was “similar in its mode of attack to the notorious banking softwareDridex.” A variant,Osiris, was spread through phishing campaigns. Leatherlockerwas first discovered in 2017 in two Android applications: Booster & Cleaner and Wallpaper Blur HD. Rather than encrypt files, it locks the home screen to prevent access to data. Wysiwye,also discovered in 2017, scans the web for open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers. It then tries to steal RDP credentials to spread across the network. Cerberproved very effective when it first appeared in 2016, netting attackers $200,000 in July of that year. It took advantage of a Microsoft vulnerability to infect networks. BadRabbitspread across media companies in Eastern Europe and Asia in 2017. SamSamhas been around since 2015 and targeted primarily healthcare organizations. Ryukfirst appeared in 2018 and is used in targeted attacks against vulnerable organizations such as hospitals. It is often used in combination with other malware like TrickBot. Mazeis a relatively new ransomware group known for releasing stolen data to the public if the victim does not pay to decrypt it. RobbinHoodis another EternalBlue variant that brought the city of Baltimore, Maryland, to its knees in 2019. GandCrabmight be the most lucrative ransomware ever. Its developers, which sold the program to cybercriminals, claim more then $2 billion in victim payouts as of July 2019. Sodinokibitargets Microsoft Windows systems and encrypts all files except configuration files. It is related to GandCrab Thanos, discovered in January 2020. It is sold as ransomware as a service, It is the first to use the RIPlace technique, which can bypass most anti-ransomware methods. This list is just going to get longer.

And in truth, there have beencomputer viruseson the internet since before it was the internet. Mikko Hyppönen, chief research officer at WithSecure, has been fighting malware and cybercrime since the 1990s. Computer viruses have evolved from a nuisance to a potential national security threat over that period. “The major shift in malware outbreaks occurred around 2003-2004,” Hyppönen tells CSO. “Before that, most attacks were created by hobbyists for fun. Some of the self-replicating worms from that era had no purpose other than to spread as quickly and widely as possible. Since then, most malware has been developed by organized crime groups or governments, and attacks have become much more targeted.” This article will take a look at some of the most important milestones in the evolution of malware: These entries each represent a novel idea, a lucky break that revealed a gaping security hole, or an attack that turned to be particularly damaging — and sometimes all three. Creeper virus (1971) Brain virus (1986) Morris worm (1988) ILOVEYOU worm (2000) Mydoom worm (2004) Zeus trojan (2007) Stuxnet (2010) CryptoLocker ransomware (2013) Emotet trojan (2014) Mirai botnet (2016) Industroyer (2016) Petya ransomware/NotPetya wiper (2016/2017) WannaCry (2017) Clop ransomware (2019-present) Darkside (2021) Computer pioneer John von Neumann’s posthumous workTheory of Self-Reproducing Automata, which posited the idea of computer code that could reproduce and spread itself, was published in 1966. Five years later, thefirst known computer virus, called Creeper, was a written by Bob Thomas. Written in PDP-10 assembly language, Creeper could reproduce itself and move from computer to computer across the nascent ARPANET. Creeper did no harm to the systems it infected — Thomas developed it as a proof of concept, and its only effect was that it caused connected teletype machines to print a message that said “I’M THE CREEPER: CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.” We’re mentioning it here despite its benign nature because it was the first, and set the template for everything that followed. Shortly after Creeper’s release, Ray Tomlinson, best known for implementing the first email program, wrote a rival program called Reaper that spread from computer to computer eliminating Creeper’s code. Creeper was designed to leap across computer networks, but for most of the 1970s and ’80s that infection vector was in limited simply because most computers operated in isolation. What malware did spread from computer to computer did so via floppy disks. The earliest example isElk Cloner, which was created by a 15-year-old as a prank and infected Apple II computers. But probablythe most important of this generation of viruseswas one that came to be known as Brain, and started spreading worldwide in 1986. Brain was developed by computer programmers (and brothers) Amjad and Basit Farooq Alvi, who lived in Pakistan and had a business selling medical software. Because their programs were often pirated, they created a virus that could infect the boot sector of pirated disks. It was mostly harmless but included contact information for them and an offer to “disinfect” the software. Whether they could actually “fix” the problem isn’t clear, but as they explained 25 years later, they soonstarted receiving phone calls from all over the world, and were shocked by how quickly and how far Brain had spread (and how mad the people who had illegally copied their software were atthem,for some reason). Today Brain is widely regarded as the first IBM PC virus, so we’re including it on our list despite its benign nature, and the brothers still have the same address and phone number that they sent out 25 years ago. 1988 saw the advent of a piece of malware called Morris, which could claim a number of firsts. It was the first widespreadcomputer worm, which meant it could reproduce itself without needing another program to piggyback on. It targeted multiple vulnerabilities to help it spread faster and further. While not designed to do harm, it was probably the first malware to do real substantive financial damage, more than earning its place on this list. It spread incredibly swiftly — within 24 hours of its release,it had infected 10% of all internet-connected computers— and created multiple copies of itself on each machine, causing many of them to grind to a halt. Estimates of the costs of the attack ranged into the millions. The worm isnamed after its creator Robert Morris, who was a Cornell grad student at the time and meant it as a proof-of-concept and demonstration of widespread security flaws. Morris didn’t anticipate that it would spread so quickly or that its ability to infect individual computers multiple times would cause so much trouble, and he tried to help undo the damage, but it was too late. He ended up the unfortunate subject of another first: The first person convicted under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Unlike the previous malware creators on this list, Onel de Guzman, who was 24 in 2000 and living in the Philippines, crafted his creation with straightforward criminal intent: he couldn’t afford dialup service, so he built a worm that would steal other people’s passwords so he could piggyback off of their accounts. But the malware so cleverly took advantage of a number of flaws in Windows 95 — especially the fact that Windows automatically hid the file extensions of email attachments so people didn’t realize they were launching executable files — that it spread like wildfire, and soon millions of infected computers were sending out copies of the worm andbeaming passwords back to a Filipino email address. It also erased numerous files on target computers, causing millions of dollars in damage and briefly shutting down the UK Parliament’s computer system. de Guzman was never charged with a crime, because nothing he did was illegal in the Philippines at the time, buthe expressed regret in an interview 20 years later, saying he never intended the malware to spread as far as it did. He also ended up being something of a pioneer insocial engineering: the worm got its name because itspread with emails with “ILOVEYOU” in the subject line. “I figured out that many people want a boyfriend, they want each other, they want love, so I called it that,” de Guzman said. Mydoom may be 20 years old, but still holds a number of records including the fastest-spreading computer worm ever. TheMydoom worm infected computers via email, then took control of the victim computer to email out more copies of itself, and did it so efficiently that at its height it accounted for a quarter of all emails sent worldwide, a feat that’s never been surpassed. The infection ended up doing an estimated $50 billion in damages. The creator and ultimate purpose of Mydoom remain mysteries today. In addition to mailing out copies of the worm, infected computers were also used as a botnet to launchDDoSattacks onthe SCO Group(a company that aggressively tried toclaim intellectual property rights over Linux) andMicrosoft, which led many to suspect somerogue member of the open source community. But nothing specific has ever been proven. Zeus was first spotted in 2007, at the tail end of the Web 1.0 era, but it showed the way for the future of what malware could be. A Trojan that infects viaphishingand drive-by downloads from infected websites, isn’t just one kind of attacker; instead, it acts as a vehicle for all sorts of malicious payloads. Its source code and operating manual leaked in 2011, which helpedboth security researchers and criminals who wanted to exploit its capabilities. You’ll usually hear Zeus referred to as a “banking Trojan,” since that’s where its variants focus much of their energy. A 2014 variant, for instance, manages tointerpose itself between a user and their banking website, intercepting passwords, keystrokes, and more. But Zeus goes beyond banks, with anothervariation slurping up Salesforce.com info. Stuxnet– the world’s first cyber-weapon – was a sophisticated worm that targeted industrial control systems. It was the first malware capable of causing physical damage to industrial equipment. Reports attribute the malware’s creation to a joint US and Israeli operation targeting industrial control systems used in Iran’s nuclear facilities at Nanantz. Stuxnetexploited multiple previously unknown Windows zero-day vulnerabilities to infect Windows systems before spreading across a network, scanning for controlling programmable logical controllers (PLC) using Siemens Step7 software. The main target for the malware was covertly procured systems used by the Iranians to control high-speed Uranium gas enrichment centrifuges. Once infected these systems were accelerated and slowed outside of normal operating conditions, effectively thrashing delicate machinery. Stuxnet sent false feedback to the system’s controller to hide the damage it had caused. The malware, whichspread internationally beyond its intended target, starkly illustrated the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyber-attacks. Zeus could also be used to createbotnetsof controlled computers held in reserve for some later sinister purpose. The controllers of one such botnet, called Gameover Zeus, infected their bots with CryptoLocker, one of the earliest prominent versions of what became known asransomware. Ransomware encrypts many of the files on the victim’s machine and demands a payment in cryptocurrency in order to restore access. CryptoLocker became famous for its rapid spreadand its powerful asymmetricencryptionthat was (at the time) uniquely difficult to break. It also became famous due to something unusual in the malware world: a happy ending. In 2014, the US DoJ and peer agencies overseas managed totake control of the Gameover Zeus botnet, and restore the files of CryptoLocker victims free of charge. Unfortunately, CryptoLocker spread via good old-fashioned phishing as well, and variants are still around. Emotet is another piece of malware whose functionality has shifted and changed of the years that it has remained active. In fact, Emotet is a prime example of what’s known aspolymorphic malware, with its code changing slightly every time it’s accessed, the better to avoid recognition byendpoint security programs.Emotet is a Trojanthat, like others on this list, primarily spreads via phishing (repeat after us:do not open unknown email attachments). Emotet first appeared in 2014, but like Zeus, is now a modular program most often used to deliver other forms of malware, with Trickster andRyukbeing two prominent examples. Emotet is so good at what it does that Arne Schoenbohm, head of the German Federal Office for Information Security, calls it the “king of malware.” All the viruses and other malware we’ve been discussing so far have afflicted what we think of as “computers” — the PCs and laptops that we use for work and play. But in the 21st century, there are millions of devices with more computing power than anything that Creeper could have infected. Theseinternet of things (IoT)devices are omnipresent, ignored, and often go unpatched for years. TheMirai botnetwas actually similar to some of the early malware we discussed because it exploited a previously unknown vulnerability and wreaked far more havoc than its creator intended. In this case, the malware found and took over IoT gadgets (mostly CCTV cameras) that hadn’t had their default passwords changed. Paras Jha, the college student who created the Mirai malware, intended to use the botnets he created for DoS attacks that would help settle scores in the obscure world of Minecraft server hosting, but instead he unleashed an attack that focused on a majorDNSprovider and cut off much of the US east coast from the internet for the better part of a day. Industroyeris a sophisticated malware framework linked to attacks on Ukraine’s power grid. An attack using Industroyer resulted in a significant power outage affecting a fifth of Kyiv for about an hour in December 2016. Previous malware variants, most notable Stuxnet, targeted industrial control systems butIndustroyer (or Crash Override)was the first to specifically target equipment associated with electrical distribution. The ransomware Trojan dubbed Petya started afflicting computers in 2016. Though it had a clever mechanism for locking down its victims’ data — it encrypts the master file table, which the OS uses to find files — it spread via conventional phishing scams and wasn’t considered particularly virulent. It would probably be forgotten today if not for what happened the following year. A new self-reproducing worm variant emerged that used the NSA’s leakedEternalBlue and EternalRomance exploitsto spread from computer to computer. Originally distributed via a backdoor in a popular Ukrainian accounting software package, the new version —dubbed NotPetya— quickly wreaked havoc across Europe. The worst part? Though NotPetya still looked like ransomware, it was a wiper designed wholly to ruin computers, as the address displayed where users could send their ransom was randomly generated and did no good. Researchers believe that Russian intelligence repurposed the more ordinary Petya malware to use as a cyberweapon against Ukraine — and so, in addition to the massive damage it caused, NotPetya earns its place on this list by illustrating the symbiotic relationship between state sponsored and criminal hackers. The notoriousWannaCry ransomware wormaffected more than 200,000 Windows computers across 150 countries when it was unleashed in May 2017. The spread of the malware resulted in substantial disruptions in critical services, including healthcare in general and the UK’s National Health Service in particular, before its spread was contained. Other victims included Telefonica in Spain, FedEx and Nissan. WannaCry exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft’s SMBv1 network protocol called EternalBlue, which was developed by the NSA and leaked by hacking group Shadow Brokers. The malware spread without user interaction across unprotected systems against the, then recently discovered, vulnerability and end-of-life Windows XP machines. UK security researcher Marcus Hutchins accidentally discovered a “kill switch” domain that stopped the malware spreading once he registered it. US authorities blamed a named suspect of North Koreafor the attack in September 2018. North Korea denies any responsibility. Although WannaCry caused massive disruption its creators made little money, as little at$80,000 by some estimates, from their nefarious actions because of flaws in the malware’s design and implementation. These shortcomings included an inability to automatically verify payments or decrypt files even after payment. Clop (sometimes written Cl0p) is another ransomware variant that emerged on the scene in 2019 and grown increasingly since, to the extent that it was dubbed one of thetop malware threats of 2022. In addition to preventing victims from accessing their data, Clop allows the attacker to exfiltrate that data as well. McAfee has abreakdown of the technical details, including a review of ways it can bypass security software. What makes Clop so interesting and dangerous, however, is not how it’s deployed, but by whom. It’s at the forefront of a trend calledransomware as a service, in which a professionalized group of hackers does all the work for whoever will pay them enough (or share in a percentage of the ransomware riches they extract from victims). The earlier entries in this list are from a day when the internet was for hobbyists and lone wolves; today, it seems even cybercrime is largely the province of governments and the professionals. TheDarkside ransomware-as-a-serviceoperation emerged in 2020, gaining infamy a year later with the attack on Colonial Pipeline in May 2021. The attack led to fuel shortages across the southeastern United States. Colonial Pipeline agreed to pay the criminals who carried out the attack 75 bitcoin (around $4.4 million at the time) in return for a decryption key. Even after receiving the key it took several days to fully restore systems. TheDarkside gang became cyber enemy number onedue to the assault, which resulted in increased efforts to combat ransomware.

Of the 1,097 respondents who shared their payment details, the average payment was $4 million — up from $1.5 million in 2023. Ransomware is a type ofmalwarethat encrypts a victim’s files. The attacker then demands a ransom from the victim to restore access to the encrypted data. According to areport released in July by Semperis, based on a survey of 900 IT and security leaders,ransomware attacksdisrupted business operations for 87% of companies. But paying ransomware is a losing game. Of those who were hit, 74% were hit multiple times, sometimes within the span of the same week. And of those who paid up, 72% paid more than once. In fact, 32% of victims paid ransoms four or more times last year. And, to rub salt into the wound, 35% of organizations who paid up didn’t receive decryption keys or had other problems with recovering files and assets. Ransomware has been around for a long time. Why are we still paying for it? Part of the reason is the lack of backups — specifically, the lack of usable backups. Backups must be safe from malware, quick and easy to recover, and include not just important files and databases but also key applications, configurations, and all the technology needed to support an entire business process. Most importantly, backups should be well-tested. Here are eight steps to ensure a successful recovery from backup after a ransomware attack. According to theSophos survey, in 94% of cases ransomware actors attempted to compromise the backups. And 57% of those attempts were successful. When attackers were able to successfully compromise the backups, the average ransom payment was $2.3 million — compared to $1 million for companies whose backups weren’t compromised. In addition, companies whose backups were compromised were twice as likely to pay the ransoms — 67% versus 36%. Those with compromised backups also had eight times higher recovery costs, separate from the ransom payments — $3 million versus $375,000. “We do see some of our clients that have on-prem backups that they run themselves, as well as cloud-based ones,” says Jeff Palatt, former vice president for technical advisory services at MoxFive, a technical advisory services company. “But ideally, if someone has both, they don’t cascade. If the encrypted files get written to the local backup solution and then get replicated to the cloud, that doesn’t do you any good.” Some cloud-based platforms include versioning as part of the product for no additional cost. For example, Office 365, Google Docs, and online backup systems like iDrive keep all previous versions of files without overwriting them. Even if ransomware strikes, and the encrypted files are backed up, the backup process just adds a new, corrupted version of the file—it doesn’t overwrite the older backups that are already there. Technology that saves continuous incremental backups of files also means that there’s no loss of data when ransomware hits. You just go back to the last good version of the file before the attack. Another way to protect backups is to use storage that can’t be written over. Use either physical write-once-read-many (WORM) technology or virtual equivalents that allow data to be written but not changed. This does increase the cost of backups since it requires substantially more storage. Some backup technologies only save changed and updated files or use other deduplication technology to keep from having multiple copies of the same thing in the archive. According to a report released in June byVeeam, many companies are already using immutable storage. According to the survey, 70% of companies use hardened disks on-premises and 89% use immutable clouds. However, of the overall backup storage used by companies, only 54% is immutable. That means that the rest is at high risk from ransomware. “In many cases, enterprises don’t have the storage space or capabilities to keep backups for a lengthy period of time,” says Palatt. “In one case, our client had three days of backups. Two were overwritten, but the third day was still viable.” If the ransomware had hit over, say, a long holiday weekend, then all three days of backups could have been destroyed. “All of a sudden you come in and all your iterations have been overwritten because we only have three, or four, or five days.” Palatt suggests that companies keep different types of backups, such as full backups on one schedule combined with incremental backups on a more frequent schedule. In addition to keeping the backup files themselves safe from attackers, companies should also ensure that their data catalogs are safe. “Most of the sophisticated ransomware attacks target the backup catalog and not the actual backup media, the backup tapes or disks, as most people think,” says Amr Ahmed, EY America’s infrastructure and service resiliency leader. This catalog contains all the metadata for the backups, the index, the bar codes of the tapes, the full paths to data content on disks, and so on. “Your backup media will be unusable without the catalog,” Ahmed says. Restoring without one would be extremely hard or impractical. Enterprises need to ensure that they have in place a backup solution that includes protections for the backup catalog, such as an air gap. When Alaska’s Kodiak Island Borough was hit by ransomware in 2016, the municipality had about three dozen servers and 45 employee PCs. All were backed up, says the company’s former IT supervisor Paul VanDyke, who ran the recovery effort. All servers were backed up, that is, except one. “I missed one server that had assessed property values,” he says. The ransom demand was small by today’s standards, just half a Bitcoin, which was then worth $259. He paid the ransom, but only used the decryption key on that one server, since he didn’t trust the integrity of the systems restored with the attackers’ help. “I assumed everything was dirty,” he says. Today, everything is covered by backup technology. Larger organizations also have a problem ensuring that everything that needs to be backed up is actually backed up. According to the Veritas survey, IT professionals estimate that, on average, they wouldn’t be able to recover 20% of their data in the event of a complete data loss. It doesn’t help that many companies, if not all companies, have a problem with shadow IT. “People are trying to do their jobs in the most convenient and efficient way possible,” says Randy Watkins, CTO at Critical Start. “Oftentimes, that means running under the radar and doing things yourself.” There’s only so much companies can do to prevent loss when critical data is sitting on a server in a back closet somewhere, especially if the data is used for internal processes. “When it comes to production, it usually hits the company’s radar somewhere,” says Watkins. “There’s a new application or a new revenue-generating service.” Not all systems can be easily found by IT so that they can be backed up. Ransomware hits, and then suddenly things are no longer working. Watkins recommends that companies do a thorough survey of all their systems and assets. This will usually involve leaders from every function, so that they can ask their people for lists of all critical systems and data that needs to be protected. Often, companies will discover that things are stored where they shouldn’t be stored, like payment data being stored on employee laptops. As a result, the backup project will often run concurrent with a data loss prevention project, Watkins says. Ransomware doesn’t just affect data files. Attackers know that the more business functions they can shut down, the more likely a company is to pay a ransom. Natural disasters, hardware failures, and network outages don’t discriminate either. After they were hit by ransomware, Kodiak Island’s VanDyke had to rebuild all the servers and PCs, which sometimes included downloading and re-installing software and redoing all the configurations. As a result, it took a week to restore the servers and another week to restore the PCs. In addition, he only had three spare servers to do the recovery with, so there was a lot of swapping back and forth, he says. With more servers, the process could have gone faster. A business process works like an orchestra, says Dave Burg, cybersecurity leader at EY Americas. “You have different parts of the orchestra making different sounds, and if they’re not in sequence with each other, what you hear is noise.” Backing up just the data without backing up all the software, components, dependencies, configurations, networking settings, monitoring and security tools, and everything else that is required for a business process to work can make recovery extremely challenging. Companies too often underestimate this challenge. “There’s a lack of understanding of the technology infrastructure and the interconnections,” says Burg. “An insufficient understanding of how the technology really works to enable the business.” The biggest infrastructure recovery challenges after a ransomware attack typically involve rebuilding Active Directory and rebuilding configuration management database capability, Burg says. It used to be that if a company wanted a full backup of its systems, not just data, that it would build a working duplicate of its entire infrastructure, a disaster recovery site. Of course, doing so doubled the infrastructure costs, making it cost prohibitive for many businesses. Today, cloud infrastructure can be used to create virtual backup data centers, one that only costs money while it is being used. And if a company is already in the cloud, setting up a backup in a different availability zone—or a different cloud—is an even simpler process. “These cloud-based hot-swap architectures are available, are cost effective, and are secure, and have a great deal of promise,” says Burg. According to Sophos, only 35% of ransomware victims are fully recovered within a week — down from 47% in 2023 and 52% in 2022. And a third takes a month or longer to recover. “I know companies who are spending a lot of money on tapes and sending them off to Iron Mountain,” says Watkins. “They don’t have the time to wait an hour to get the tapes back and 17 days to restore them.” A hot site, one that’s available at the switch of a key, would solve the recovery time problem. With today’s cloud-based infrastructure, there’s no reason not to have one. “It’s a no-brainer,” says Watkins. “You can have a script that copies your infrastructure and stands it up in another availability zone or another provider altogether. Then have the automation ready to go so that you hit play. There’s no restore time, just 10 or 15 minutes to turn it on. Maybe a full day if you go through testing.” Why aren’t more companies doing this? First, there’s a substantial cost to the initial setup, Watkins says. “Then you need that expertise in house, that automation expertise and cloud expertise in general,” he says. “Then there are things like security controls that you need to set up ahead of time.” There are also legacy systems that don’t transfer to the cloud. Watkins points to oil and gas controllers as an example of something that can’t be replicated in the cloud. For the most part, the initial cost of setting up the backup infrastructure should be a moot point, Watkins says. “Your cost to set up the infrastructure is much less than paying the ransomware and dealing with the reputation damage.” For companies struggling with this, one approach could be to focus on the most critical business processes first, suggests Tanner Johnson, principal analyst for data security at Omdia. “You don’t want to buy a million-dollar lock to protect a thousand-dollar asset,” he says. “Define what your crown jewels are. Establish a hierarchy and priority for your security team.” There’s a cultural barrier to investing proactively in cybersecurity, Johnson admits. “We are a reactionary society, but cybersecurity is finally being seen for what it is: an investment. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” “A lot of people are approaching backups from a backup point of view, not a recovery point of view,” says Mike Golden, senior delivery manager for cloud infrastructure services at Capgemini. “You can back up all day long, but if you don’t test your restore, you don’t test your disaster recovery, you’re just opening yourself to problems.” This is where a lot of companies go wrong, Golden says. “They back it up and go away and are not testing it.” They don’t know how long the backups will take to download, for example, because they haven’t tested it. “You don’t know all the little things that can go wrong until it happens,” he says. It’s not just the technology that needs to be tested, but the human element as well. “People don’t know what they don’t know,” Golden says. “Or there’s not a regular audit of their processes to make sure that people are adhering to policies.” When it comes to people following required backup processes and knowing what they need to do in a disaster recovery situation, the mantra, Golden says, should be “trust but verify.” The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency(CISA) has a frameworkfor companies to follow that covers the main steps that need to be taken after a ransomware attack. Evaluate the scope of damage: The first step is to identify all affected systems and devices. That can include on-premises hardware as well as cloud infrastructure. CISA recommends using out-of-band communications during this stage, such as phone calls, to avoid letting the attackers know that they have been discovered and what actions you are planning to take. Isolate systems:Remove affected devices from the network or turn off their power. If there are several affected systems or subnets, take them offline at the network level, or power down switches or disconnect cables. However, powering down devices might destroy evidence stored in volatile memory, so should be a last resort. In addition, protectively isolate the most mission-critical systems that are still untouched from the rest of the network. Triage affected systems for recovery:Prioritize systems critical for health or safety, revenue generation, and other critical business services as well as the systems that they depend on. Restore from offline, encrypted backups and golden images that have been tested to be free of infection. Execute your notification plan:Depending on your cyber incident response and communications plan, notify internal and external teams and stakeholders. These can include the IT department, managed security service providers, cyber insurance company, corporate leaders, customers, and the public, as well as government agencies in your country. If the incident involved a data breach, follow legal notification requirements. Containment and eradication:Collect system images and memory captures of all affected devices, as well as relevant logs and samples of related malware and early indicators of compromise. Identify ransomware variant and follow recommended remediation steps for that variant. If data has been encrypted, consult federal law enforcement for possible decryptors that may be available. Secure networks and accounts against further compromise, since the attackers may still have their original access credentials or obtained more during the breach. In addition, extended analysis should be conducted to find persistent infection mechanisms to keep them from reactivating. According to Sophos, only a minority of ransomware victims recover in a week or less. On average, 35% took less than a week. About a third took between a week and a month. And the final third, 34%, took a month or more to recover. Only 7% of victims recovered in less than a day — and 8% of victims took three months or longer. Recovery times are significantly reduced, however, if a company has good backups. If a company’s backups were also compromised, only 25% of companies recovered in less than a week. But if the backups were not compromised, 46% of companies took less than a week to get back on their feet. CISA has adetailed list of best practices for preventing ransomware. Backups:CISA recommends maintaining offline, encrypted backups of critical data and testing these backups and recovery procedures on a regular basis. Enterprises should also have golden images of critical systems, as well as configuration files for operating systems and key applications that can be quickly deployed to rebuild systems. Companies may also consider investing in backup hardware or backup cloud infrastructure to ensure business continuity. Incident response plan: Enterprises should create, maintain, and regularly exercise a cyber incident response plan and associated communication plan. This plan should include all legally required notifications, organizational communications procedures, and make sure that all key players have hard copies or offline versions of this plan. Prevention:CISA recommends that companies move to a zero-trust architecture to prevent unauthorized access. Other key preventative measures include minimizing the number of services exposed to the public, especially frequently targeted services like remote desktop protocol. You should conduct regular vulnerability scanning, regularly patch and update software, implement phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication, implementidentity and access managementsystems, change all default admin usernames and passwords, use role-based access instead of root access accounts, and check the security configurations of all company devices and cloud services, including personal devices used for work. CISA also has specific recommendations for protecting against the most common initial access vectors, such asphishing, malware,social engineering, and compromised third parties.

6 things hackers know that they don’t want security pros to know that they know,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3498359/6-things-hackers-know-that-they-dont-want-security-pros-to-know-that-they-know.html,"Hackers bring key knowledge about their targets to their nefarious trade and CISOs should consider that reality when building their own defensive strategies.

They are likewise well-versed in key defensive strategies, such as prioritizing patching based on risk and implementing azero-trustapproach. But the world of enterprise security collectively seems to remain one step behind the hackers, who continue to successfully launch a growing number of attacks year over year. Here’s one reason why: many CISOs underappreciate, overlook, and sometimes underestimate all the knowledge that hackers are bringing to the table — the nontechnical insights that they’re using to gain the upper hand. “Hackers know that the average CISO has a lot on their plates and they don’t have enough [resources] to get everything done. So CISOs really have to pay attention to what hackers are doing and what they know so they can best defend against them,” says Stephanie “Snow” Carruthers, chief people hacker at IBM. What, then, do hackers know that may not get enough credence? Here are six strategies that hackers employ to craft their attacks that may not be on a CISO’s radar according to security researchers. When COVID hit, executives focused on shepherding their organizations and employees safely through the crisis. Hackers, on the other hand, saw an opportunity to exploit. In fact, hackers willingly seize on any vulnerability they can — no matter how low, says Erik J. Huffman, founder of cybersecurity services firm Handshake Leadership. They’re willing to take down the CEO, embarrass the CFO, ruin careers, and cripple critical services to get what they want. “Criminals are stooping to levels we didn’t expect them to stoop to,” Huffman says. Most CISOs haven’t internalized that fact, even if they’re aware of it, Huffman says. Instead, they generally craft anti-phishing campaigns, security awareness training programs, and security drills that don’t incorporate below-the-belt punches. For example, they generally don’t devise highly personalized emails that mimic targeted phishing campaigns because it might be perceived as an overly aggressive move. That’s a mistake, and it’s one that hackers exploit because “they’re willing to attack in ways that CISOs don’t. That means we don’t quite train how the fight is happening,” Huffman says. He advises security executives and devises anti-phishing campaigns, simulations, and drills that more closely mimic the down-and-dirty strategies that hackers use. “Take the gloves off; really challenge your team.” It’s not a coincidence that many attacks happen at the most challenging of times. Hackers really do increase their attacks on weekends and holidays when security teams are lean. And they’re more likely to strike right before lunchtime and end-of-day, when workers are rushing and consequently less attentive to red flags indicating a phishing attack or fraudulent activity. “Hackers typically deploy their attacks during those times because they’re less likely to be noticed,” says Melissa DeOrio,global threat intelligence lead at S-RM, a global intelligence and cybersecurity consultancy. DeOrio acknowledges that many hackers are located in countries whose daytime work hours neatly coincide with the nonworking hours in the Americas and Western Europe. But she says evidence shows hackers do indeed take advantage of that difference by calculating the timing of their attacks. Additionally, threat actors look for periods of organizational change (i.e., mergers, acquisitions, layoffs, etc.) to exploit, says Tomer Bar, vice president of security research at SafeBreach. “Threat actors will try to launch an attack at the most difficult time for the CISO and the blue team.” Although CISOs generally know that hackers time their attacks, experts say some may be unaware of just how strategic hackers are when it comes to researching and plotting opportune times. Moreover, Bar says CISOs may not be as attentive as they should be to this issue. To counter this hacker strategy, longtime security leaders advise CISOs to account for it in their own defense strategies. They should leverage third-party services during off-business hours to complement the security team’s work schedule, add more automation to boost staff efficiency at all hours, add extra layers of security such as more monitoring or tighter filters at times of heightened risk, ensure priority security work happens before busy times such as holidays, and educate all staffers about the heightened risks that exist during such times. DeOrio also recommends running an incident response drill as if the incident was happening at a particularly problematic time — perhaps the middle of the night during summer vacation season — so that the security team can identify and close any gaps in its response. Threat actors actively engage inopen-source intelligence(OSINT) gathering, looking for information they can use to devise attacks, Carruthers says. It’s not surprising that hackers look for news about transformative events such as big layoffs, mergers and the like, she says. But CISOs, their teams and other executives may be surprised to learn that hackers also look for news about seemingly innocuous events such as technology implementations, new partnerships, hiring sprees, and executive schedules that could reveal when they’re out of the office. Granted, such low-level activities don’t produce the same worker anxiety or organizational confusion that downsizing and M&As do — and, thus, don’t present the same opportunities for hackers. However, Carruthers says they still create changes that hackers can use to their advantage. “They all breed opportunities for attackers.” Carruthers knows firsthand how effective such hacker strategies are. Her team of ethical hackers runs exercises that start by gathering information from six months’ worth of announcements, blogs, social media posts, and online forums where employees share their own thoughts. Then her team determines where and how to strike based on that information-gathering, just as hackers would. She says her team might use something positive against the company by crafting a phishing campaign that says a popular employee perk is ending. Or the team might seize on a migration to a new technology to more easily get employees to share login or credential information. Although CISOs can’t shut off the flow of news, they can counter hackers’ ability to successfully use it against their organizations, Carruthers says. They can monitor OSINT about their organizations, work with other executives on announcements and the timing of those announcements, and run simulations on how such announcements play out from a business perspective. All that helps CISOs and their teams see what hackers see, better understand their thinking and prepare for possible targeted attacks. Security awareness training typically instructs individuals to take time to review emails or think through requests to help determine whether a request is legitimate or suspicious. Yet workplace culture today generally works against that approach, Huffman says. “We praise ourselves for putting ourselves in an emotional hot state,” he says, pointing to job postings that use phrases such as “fast-paced,” “dynamic” and “high-intensity” to describe the workplace culture as evidence. Employees in such environments don’t have — nor are they encouraged to take — extra time to evaluate incoming messages (whether they’re via email, phone, video, text, etc.), Huffman says. “And that’s why hackers are successful: they catch us in constant emotional hot states when you’re clicking through 1,000 emails.” CISOs and their executive colleagues could create a more secure organization by lowering the temperature. “Most companies I consult with don’t understand how hard their teams are working and how much pressure their teams are under. They think they have great cultures but little do they know they’re teams are working overtime. But if they encourage them to slow down, if they can [identify] what can wait for tomorrow, if they could allow people to relax, they’d do better securing [their organization],” Huffman says. Deepfakesare absolutely good enough to trick employees, as evidenced by reports earlier this year that an employee at British engineering firm Arup was duped by scammers who used a deepfake of the company’s CFO to request a $25-million transfer. “Deep fakes have been around for almost 10 years but the technology has gotten much better,” says Kev Breen, who as senior director of cyber threat research at Immersive Labs researches new and emerging cyber threats. He notes that deepfake audios are particularly mature today. “A deepfake video is still hard to do, but it doesn’t take much audio to create convincing clips.” He says most CISOs are aware that audio and video deepfakes are now good enough to be convincing but many other executives and employees aren’t as aware of this emerging threat. And while these deepfake attacks are highly targeted, hackers are counting on that widespread lack of awareness to help boost their success rates. Although security tools to detect and block deepfakes don’t exist, CISOs can blunt the threat by educating workers on the threat and how to detect possible deepfake audio and video as well as by updating protocols around business processes such as money transfers to ensure those requesting such actions are legit. Defense-in-depth can boost an organization’s security posture, yet many organizations aren’t getting that benefit because their controls aren’t independent, says Lou Steinberg, founder and managing partner of CTM Insights, a cybersecurity research lab and incubator, as well as a member of MITRE’s Science & Technology Advisory Committee and former TD Ameritrade CTO. “I’ve seen cases where what should be independent controls are all run on the same box. And hackers know when they compromise that one server, they can compromise multiple controls all at once,” Steinberg says. He also had worked with one company in the past where a penetration test revealed that a network control and a non-network control were both running on the same on-premises server. “Both controls could get bypassed together, which isn’t good,” he says. He also has heard of similar scenarios in the cloud, such as where the credentials for the security control — such as acloud access security broker(CASB) or a web application firewall — were the same as the credentials for the organization’s cloud administrator. Steinberg says closing this security gap is relatively easy: Make sure controls are independent so that a compromise of one doesn’t compromise any others so that the organization truly has defense in depth — and not just the illusion of it.

Top 10 ransomware groups to watch,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3509281/top-10-ransomware-groups-to-watch.html,"From LockBit 3.0 to DragonForce, these are the most active or sophisticated ransomware groups that CISOs want to watch out for. LockBit 3.0 Play ransomware 8Base Akira Black Basta BlackByte RansomHub Hunters International Medusa DragonForce Related content Governments won’t like this: encrypted messaging between Android and iOS devices coming, says GSMA Report on ransomware attacks on Fortinet firewalls also reveals possible defenses The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time The state of ransomware: Fragmented but still potent despite takedowns Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  The ransomware landscape has seen a lot of fragmentation over the past couple of years with major groups shutting down after they became the target of law enforcement actions or after they attracted too much attention and had ransoms put on their leaders’ identities. Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations are heavily reliant on third-party hackers, known as affiliates, to break into victim networks, steal data and deploy their file encryption programs. These affiliates earn a large percentage from the ransoms paid by victims, so there’s constant competition between different ransomware operations to entice affiliates with better commission deals or the promise of better operational security. It’s also not uncommon for large groups to splinter off into smaller ones due to internal fights between administrators or for groups to shut down and rebrand when they get too much heat. This means the ransomware ecosystem is in a constant state of change, with new groups emerging, rising to the top and then shutting down for various reasons. Here are 10 of the most active or sophisticated ransomware groups that have been active in 2024, and organizations should watch out for. LockBitfirst appeared onto the scene in 2019 and was briefly called ABCD by security researchers —because the early variants left encrypted files with the .abcd extension — but started really taking off during the second half of 2021 with the release of LockBit 2.0. This was followed in 2022 by LockBit 3.0, a big revamp of its affiliate program and aggressive tactics thatquickly propelled it to the top of the rankingswhere it dominated for much of 2022 and 2023. LockBit’s rise was also fueled along the way by the downfall of other major groups including Ryuk, REvil, Maze and Conti, whose affiliates it managed to attract with competitive deals. In February 2024, law enforcement agencies from 10 countries including Australia, the UK and the US managed todisrupt the LockBit operationsby seizing its websites and servers. The information obtained from that effort, dubbed Operation Cronos, led to the identification of several LockBit affiliates, as well as the user named LockBitSupp,who is believed to be the creator and administrator of the notorious ransomware service. The US State Department put up a $10-million reward for information leading to the arrest of LockBitSupp, whom they identified as Dimitry Yuryevich Khoroshev, a 31-year-old Russian national from the city of Voronezh. The law enforcement action dealt a serious blow to the LockBit operation, not only because of the disruption caused by the seized infrastructure and decryption keys, but because it compromised collaborators’ trust in its operational security. After attracting affiliates from other groups over the past several years, it was now LockBit’s turn to lose them. By April, the group had already lost its no. 1 position in favor of a ransomware operation called Play and the number of new victims it posted on its data leak site dropped considerably. That said, according to ananalysis by researchers from Palo Alto Networksof data leak postings by ransomware groups, LockBit remains number one for the first six months of 2024 with over twice as many victims than Play. According toransomware statistics by NCC Group, LockBit is also still very active, taking second place in July after RansomHub, another group where many LockBit affiliates migrated to. Even though the number of monthly LockBit attacks are way lower than they used to be before the law enforcement takedown, the operation remains active and still has highly experienced and capable members. Play, also known as Playcrypt, is a ransomware operation that has been around since 2022 and, like LockBit, has benefited from the demise of larger groups like Conti and BlackCat (ALPHV), which shut down its operations in March. The group engages in double extortion, like most modern ransomware operations, by both encrypting data on systems and stealing it to then extort companies under the threat of releasing it publicly. Play’s file encryptor program performs intermittent encryption, meaning it only encrypts specific-sized chunks of data within files instead of their entire content. This makes the encryption operation much faster and harder to detect but has the same result of leaving files unusable. The program attaches the extension .play to the impacted files. It’s worth noting that the group also has a Linux file encryption program which is used to encrypt virtual machines in their victims’ VMWare ESXi environments. Play’s affiliates are known to exploit known vulnerabilities in public-facing systems such as Microsoft Exchange servers or Fortinet FortiOS appliances to break into networks, as well as using compromised RDP credentials. From there they use a variety of third-party tools to perform reconnaissance and lateral movement and to achieve persistence, including Cobalt Strike, Mimikatz, Grixba, AlphaVSS, IOBit, AdFind, BloodHound, GMER, Plink, Process Hacker and more. According to the Palo Alto Networks’analysis, Play had the second highest number of victims (155) published on its data leak site during the first six months of the year and in July it ranked no. 5 in NCC’s stats with 20 attacks. Security firm Zscaler also ranked it no. 5 in itsannual ransomware reportthat covers the period of April 2023 through to April 2024, with a total of 345 victims. By comparison, LockBit claimed 988 victims over the same period. The third spot in ransomware rankings during the first half of this year has been occupied by8Base, a double-extortion ransomware group that also started operations in 2022, but saw a big spike in activity in 2023. 8Base is a bit of a weird group because it displayed similarities to other data extortion gangs such as RansomHouse, prompting speculation that they might be related. The group doesn’t have its own dedicated ransomware program either and instead deploys a customized variant ofPhobos, another RaaS file encryptor. 8Base primarily uses phishing scams with malicious links for initial access and, as most ransomware groups, relies on a variety or system utilities, third-party hacking tools and malicious programs: Mimikatz, LaZagne, PasswordFox, KILLAV, SmokeLoader, SystemBC, PCHunter, GMER, Process Hacker and more. The custom Phobos file encryptor used by the group appends the .8base extension to encrypted files. 8Base has managed to compromise organizations from many industries, including manufacturing, finance, legal services, construction, healthcare, but a large number of its victims are small businesses with under 200 employees. Akirais a group that first appeared in April 2023 and was thought to be an offshoot of the defunct Conti group because its file encryptor shared many code similarities with Conti’s ransomware program. However, the code of Conti’s file encryptor was leaked so this is not necessarily a strong link, but a blockchain analysis also uncovered potential links to the Conti operation. The new Akira group shouldn’t be confused with an older ransomware group of the same name that was active in 2017 and is likely unrelated, even though both groups used the .akira file extension for encrypted files. In the second half of 2023, Akira moved away from its C++ file encryptor to a Rust-based one it dubbed Megazord and which uses the .powerranges file encryption. The group also uses a Linux file encryptor for ESXi hosts. Akira gains initial access by using stolen VPN and RDP credentials, by exploiting vulnerabilities in Cisco security appliances and through phishing. Once inside a network its affiliates will use various techniques and tools for credential scraping, lateral movement and persistence. Some of these include: Kerberoasting, Mimikatz, LaZagne, SoftPerfect, Advanced IP Scanner, FileZilla, WinRAR, WinSCP, RClone, AnyDesk, MobaXterm, RustDesk, Ngrok and Cloudflare Tunnel. Based on Palo Alto Networks’ analysis of data leak sites, Akira posted 119 victims on its data leak site during the first half of this year and NCC’s attack telemetry puts it in third place for July behind RansomHub and LockBit. Another suspected Conti offshoot,Black Bastais a ransomware group that first appeared in April 2022 and is believed to have targeted over 500 organizations to date, with 114 victims listed on its site this year. This is even more impressive, considering that unlike other groups, Black Basta is very selective about its targets and does not adopt spray-and-pray tactics. The group uses spear-phishing, buys access into networks from other access brokers and even recruits company insiders for information. One technique used by the group was to flood targets with spam emails then call them posing as IT support engineers with the goal of convincing them to install remote access tools like AnyDesk or Windows Quick Assist. The group relies on the QakBot and Pikabot for initial access, but both of those botnets have been the target of law enforcement operations. Other techniques have involved exploiting vulnerabilities such as CVE-2024-26169 in Microsoft Windows Reporting Service, CVE-2024-1709 in ConnectWise, ZeroLogon (CVE-2020-1472), NoPac (CVE-2021-42278 and CVE-2021-42287) and PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-34527). Black Basta is believed to have former Conti and REvil members amongst its operators and affiliates and has cybercriminals with a lot of experience and sophisticated skill sets. Similar to Black Basta,BlackByteis another sophisticated Conti offshoot. While this group does not stand out through the high number of publicly known victims, recent research by Cisco Talos suggests that the group is much more active than previously believed and that only between 20% to 30% of its successful compromises are listed on its data leak site. RansomHub is a new RaaS operation that emerged in February 2024 but quickly rose through the ranks. NCC lists it as the top ransomware group by the number of attacks observed in July. According to aCISA and FBI advisoryfrom 29 August, the group has made over 210 victims so far. Using a customized variant of the older Knight (Cyclops) ransomware, RansomHub has managed to quickly attract new affiliates to its program by offering a very attractive 90% commission from paid ransom payments and the possibility for affiliates to negotiate with victims directly. The group is opportunistic in its attacks and has relied on the SocGolish malware for initial access. This malware program is delivered through search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning. However, some of its affiliates are known to have a lot of experience. For example, a former BlackCat affiliate who was responsible for thecompromise of UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Change Healthcareswitched over to RansomHub after the BlackCat operators ran away with the $22 million ransom payment and shut down the operation. RansomHub affiliates are also known to exploit known vulnerabilities for initial access, such as Citrix ADC (NetScaler) remote code execution (CVE-2023-3519), Fortinet FortiOS buffer overflow (CVE-2023-279970, Apache ActiveMQ remote code execution (CVE-2023-46604), Confluence Data Center and server authentication bypass (CVE-2023-22515) and others. Tools used by the group include Mimikatz, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), PsExec, Anydesk, Connectwise, N-Able, Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, Nmap, RClone, AngryIPScanner, WinSCP and PowerShell. Hunters International is a ransomware group that first appeared in October 2023. Researchers were quick to spot many code similarities in its file encryptor to the one previously used by Hive, one of the top ransomware groups that operated between 2021 and January 2023 when the FBI dismantled its operations following a seven-month covert operation. Hunters International claimed that the similarity in code is because they acquired the old Hive source code and infrastructure and improved on it, but some security researchers still view the group as a potential rebranding of Hive. According to the Zscaler’s report, Hunters International posted 97 victims until April, but the group’s activity has only increased since then. NCC’s telemetry for July places the group in fourth place by number of observed attacks. Hunters International’s file encryptor is written in the Rust programming language, but the group has also been seen deploying aremote access trojan dubbed SharpRhinoin recent attacks. Medusais a RaaS operation that started in late 2022 and gained prominence in 2023. The group is different from MedusaLocker, another RaaS operation that has been around since 2021. Medusa affiliates exploit known vulnerabilities in public-facing systems for initial access but also acquire access from access brokers. They use living-of-the-land tactics by relying on system utilities to expand their access and move laterally through networks. Its file encryptor uses RSA encryption and adds the extension .medusa to encrypted files. According to the Palo Alto Networks’ analysis of data leaks sites, Medusa compromised 103 organizations during the first half of 2024. DragonForceis another newcomer to the ransomware space that made a name for itself in 2024 and is quickly rising through the ranks. The group is known for unusual extortion tactics such as calling the victims and then publishing the recordings online. The group uses a ransomware program that is based on LockBit because the builder for LockBit 3.0 was leaked on underground forums. However, researchers don’t believe there is any connection between these two groups, other than opportunistic use of the leaked builder — the program used to configure and generate a customized LockBit executable. DragonForce attackers use phishing, as well as compromised RDP and VPN credentials for initial access into networks.

To pay or not to pay: CISOs weigh in on the ransomware dilemma,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3488842/to-pay-or-not-to-pay-cisos-weigh-in-on-the-ransomware-dilemma.html,"Many factors are driving more and more enterprises to pay ransoms of late. But ethical concerns remain, as shared by several CISOs who also note the limited influence they may have on the ultimate ransomware decision. Calculating the direct and indirect costs of ransomware The ethics of paying ransomware CISO as key influencer Buying time with third-party experts Related content Report on ransomware attacks on Fortinet firewalls also reveals possible defenses The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time The state of ransomware: Fragmented but still potent despite takedowns CISOs and CIOs forge vital partnerships for business success Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  In its “2024 Voice of the CISO” report, Proofpoint found thatransomwareremains a top concern among CISOs worldwide. More surprising, however, is how CISOs say their organizations would deal with a specific incident: 62% stated that their enterprise would likely pay a ransom to restore access to systems. The top three countries where CISOs anticipated this course of action were Saudi Arabia at 83%, Canada at 82%, and South Korea at 79%. These figures may come as a shock. Enterprises usually take a hardline stance against other threat actors, including disgruntled employees, corporate spies, hacktivists, and cyber terrorists. Why are so many willing to negotiate with ransomware operators, procure and send cryptocurrency to a given address, and cross their fingers in the hope that they stay true to their side of the bargain? We spoke with several CISOs on what factors are involved in making this crucial decision — and what influence the CISO ultimately has in determining the chosen course. Leonard Kleinman, CISO of Enablis, a managed service provider in Australia, says enterprises often cooperate based on a cost-benefit analysis. “If we look at it from a very basic economics perspective, it’s simply a cost versus benefit [equation],” he says. “Simple analysis tells you that [you should] compare the value of the organization’s revenues on a yearly basis — whatever that case is — versus what the ransomware cost is going to be.” He pointed to theColonial Pipeline attackin May 2021 as an example. The US fuel transportation company paid a ransom inBitcoin equivalent to US$4.4 million, a drop in the bucket given that it madeUS$1.3 billion the previous year. The company would have lost significantly more from the continued disruption to its operations. Referencing the ransomware attack onKaseya in Switzerland in 2021, Derek Gooh, CISO of Singapore grocery retailer NTUC, adds that there is not only the direct cost of lost business but also the opportunity cost of restoration. “If you imagine, to recover all these things, to rebuild the machine from scratch — it takes time,” he says. From this perspective, paying the ransom is tempting. “But if you have a recovery key, if you have a decryption key, it could be a 3-minute affair,” Gooh says. “You know that the malware is still inside there and all that. But at least, with the key, you [can quickly] come back on — you don’t have to close the shop.” Chris Haigh, CISO of MercuryIT, an Australian managed services provider, says critical industries may have an additional incentive to avoid downtime. “Think medical services: Large hospitals serving a region of a city or a singular town center — it becomes a critical service. So that may weigh into why they decide [they’re] going to take a chance of paying because [they] can’t afford to have all these services offline,” he says. Ken Newton, CISO of secondwave, a risk adjustment solutions provider in the US, says that when a company deals with a cyber insurer, they want to cut the losses as quickly as possible. “And they often will allow for a ransom to be paid, knowing that while there is not full honor amongst thieves, there is a history of return on that payment to get an organization back up and operating again quickly,” he says. Enablis’ Kleinman explains that businesses must also consider legal and regulatory liabilities — risks that can be intertwined with any financial consequences, especially for larger companies, he says, giving the example of a ransomware operator who encrypts a corporation’s data and goes to the stock exchange where it is listed. “‘Oh, by the way, did you know that Acme XYZ over there has been encrypted?’” he says. Kleinman explains that this is a regulatory risk because publicly listed companies must perform continuous disclosure, given that it is material to the price of their stock. If the ransomware group informs the stock exchange, the company may be in violation of this policy, exposing itself to further regulatory scrutiny and punishment. If paying ransomware only involved cost-benefit analysis, there would likely be 100% compliance with demands. However, the ethics of paying a ransomware operator are much more oblique, giving enterprises additional factors to consider. Newton of secondwave says his stance would be not to pay a ransom to a ransomware operator. “I think about where that money ends up. I think about what it funds,” he says. Although all ransomware operators are criminals, their ultimate aims are diverse. Some are out purely for profit, while others may be connected to rogue nations such as North Korea. MercuryIT’s Haigh notes that some ransomware operators may even be sanctioned entities by authorities such as the US Department of Treasury. “We’ve seen, for example, in the UK, US, and even Australia to some extent, where governments have come out and said, ‘Look, you need to be aware that if you pay a ransomware and the payment goes to a sanctioned entity, you can actually face quite serious penalties of litigation,’” he says. Kleinman adds that most businesses want to avoid interfacing with these criminal groups due to the impression it might make if they did otherwise. “They generally want to be able to look at others — their peers in the industry and across industries — and sort of say they’ve done the right thing from a moral and ethical perspective,” he says. Moreover, giving in to demands fuels further bad actions, Kleinman and others argue. “Don’t pay because it just incentivizes them,” he says. “Don’t pay because it actually rewards and funds the next attack,” he says. Gooh references the example of a law firm in Singapore thatpaid a S$1.8 million ransomin April 2024, which caused the local authorities to discourage payments. “It’s easy to understand, right? I mean, if Singapore [companies] were known to have a weak spot for paying ransom, then we’ll get attacked more, and it’s all a vicious cycle, so to speak,” says Gooh. Kleinman, however, is quick to point out that organizations aren’t stuck making an either-or decision about whether to comply with authorities, most of whom indeed discourage payments to ransomware operators. “There’s an understanding these days that the authorities — when engaged appropriately — can help organizations at least mitigate some of the challenges, [such as] losses and things like that,” he says. “They may still pay, but it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s one or the other in that sense.” Haigh believes that companies should never pay ransomware operators — and that governments should consider making doing so illegal. “If companies stop paying, there will be short-term pain, unfortunately. So some businesses will go under. … It’s a terrible situation,” he says. “But it’s the only way that this will actually stop. If no one’s paying, then why are you going to [bother with] ransomware? There’s literally no reason to do it.” Because the CISO’s mandate is to ensure the organization’s security, one would assume that this leader has the final say on whether to pay a ransom in a ransomware attack. “Here’s the fun part: CISOs don’t get to decide that,” says Kleinman, who learned of a CISO’s role in a ransomware attack from peers. “And I actually learned that in a discussion with other CISOs. Because I actually answered, ‘I wouldn’t pay.’ And then the next two guys that I really respected in the Portland area, both either a CISO or a director of security, both said, ‘It’s not my decision,’” says Kleinman. Although they may not be the decision-makers, CISOs are still key influencers to their CEOs or boards. In this capacity, Kleinman says he would advise not paying based on the risk to production, legal and regulatory liabilities, and loss of revenue. “I [would] talk about those four risks. And I [would] try to equate them to the risk to the reputation,” he says. Kleinman concedes that he has an uphill battle here. Whereas it may have once been bad publicity to comply with ransomware operators, he believes this is no longer true. He says that cyber insurers have normalized ransom payments. “I think that because federal entities even help … there are companies that exist that assist in negotiation of ransom. That is their sole task. That is [why there] is no longer as much of a reputational hit as it once was,” he adds. Although thenow public nature of ransomware paymentsmay challenge that. Another challenge is that CISOs may have direct opposition within the C-suite. Haigh references the ransomware attack on theToll Group in 2020. “The biggest issue they had [was] that they couldn’t pay their people, and it was like on a weekly or fortnightly basis. And if you’re not paying your drivers and stuff, that business stops, right?” says Haigh. “The person that was under the most stress was the CFO. [He] could see themselves going into a bankrupt state. … I think they only had like a month to run.” When an organization faces insolvency, most of the C-suite would be in favor of paying a ransom so they can continue with operations. “Because now you’re talking about essentially an existential threat to your business. And it is the CEO, CFO, [and] the board’s responsibility to not let that happen. So it’s almost like you add a juxtaposition here. Because for the greater good, you should not pay the ransomware. But for your immediate micro view of keeping this business alive, you should. That is a hard one,” he says. To make the best decision, businesses should check whether their data can be restored from backups and whether their cyber insurance covers operational expenses in the event of prolonged business disruption. Both would give enterprises leverage to avoid paying the ransom. With ransomware getting “faster, smarter, and meaner,” some ransomware operators are increasingly threatening to leak the data, which may cause the enterprise to take additional action. “You’re going to [have to] use a third party that’s going to scour the dark web, find the data, and be able to either retrieve it or take it down. And that’s the best you can do in that case,” he says. Such is the cat-and-mouse game of modern ransomware. Ransomware operators continually innovate new techniques to exert more pressure on the C-suite and board to pay. Kleinman says that some ransomware operators are targeting information that may hit closer to home. “[Ransomware operators are] quite creative. They’ve started to dox a lot of executives, senior board members. So that is releasing personal sensitive data on the individual — like the chairman of the board or something like that, or their family — again, to further incentivize the payment,” he says. Kleinman says this trend is in line with the rise of non-encryption ransomware, a threat built around data leakage. Suppose a company decides to give in to the pressure. In that case, Gooh says they should consider bringing in a third-party expert to interface with the ransomware operator and, more importantly, buy time to look for decryption keys (which are available for some ransomware strains), coordinate with authorities, and negotiate for a lower price. Gooh says that every enterprise’sincident response planshould provide this kind of professional help. “Knowing what to do and knowing who you can call when this kind of thing happens is certainly one of the things that companies need to be prepared for,” he says. Newton says that it is a relief that the ultimate decision to pay a ransom does not rest on his shoulders as a CISO, but he would still make a strong case for non-payment. “If I was asked if I would pay a ransom, I would talk about the ethics of it,” he says. “And sometimes ethics is painful. Being ethical is painful.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS Report on ransomware attacks on Fortinet firewalls also reveals possible defenses The most notorious and

Some phishing attacks target customers rather than employees, and others simply aim to damage your corporate reputation rather than compromise your systems. A key factor in protecting your business from phishing is to understand your vulnerabilities, weigh the potential risk to your business, and decide what tools offer the best protection to match your business needs. Most phishing attacks are less about the technology and more aboutsocial engineering. It’s amazing how easily humans are manipulated when emotions are triggered. Many modern phishing emailsplay on empathy or fear, or even make hostile accusations in order to trigger an angry response. Another reason phishing is so successful and popular is that it can be used to disrupt a target in a number of different ways — for example, by impacting human productivity by requiring employees to manually validate message contents or to involve corporate IT, or compromising financial accounts or enterprise systems (often leading to ransomware attacks). On the flip side, phishing is hard to prevent because of the risk of false positives disrupting legitimate business communication. A big part of protecting your business, employees, and customers from phishing attacks is by leveraging industry standards and implementing best practices whenever possible.Standards like Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)are all intended to fight the prevalence of SPAM by allowing receiving email servers to authenticate the servers they receive mail from. Put another way, the goal of these standards is to ensure that mail servers claiming to be sending on behalf of your domain is authorized to do so. Each of these standards are based in DNS and are relatively straightforward to implement. In fact, you probably get your email through a service provider like Google or Microsoft, and that service includes up to date implementation of these standards. Professional email services like these provide some level of protection against phishing already, but they are far from perfect, leaving open a market for these services. One major attack method is geared toward stealing information through low-tech methods such as email replies. Tools like content policies available in business productivity services such as Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and even as a third-party tool from multiple vendors, are invaluable for preventing this sort of attack from reaching a successful conclusion. Content policies help automate the identification of key information types like credit card or bank account numbers, social security numbers, and other information that should be closely guarded, and prevent this information from being sent outside the organization. The biggest risk stemming from phishing attacks for most enterprises is system compromise ultimately resulting in financial or data loss (or even ransomware). As such the primary defense mechanism must be a strong form of multi-factor authentication (MFA) and authentication standards such asFast Identity Online v2 (FIDO2)orWeb Authentication (WebAuthn). Ideally enterprises should be taking MFA a step further and introducing password-less authentication using zero-trust. Modern authentication strategies like risk-based authentication andSecurity Assertion Markup Language (SAML)are also powerful tools in preventing the worst-case scenario from occurring due to a successful phishing attack. Each of these components have a role to play in your organization, but the benefits are two-fold: the damage done from a compromised password is minimized (if not eradicated), and systems are put in place to be able to analyze authentication attempts and react to compromised credentials in real time. Anti-phishing tools attempt to mitigate risk at several steps in the attack process. Most commonly anti-phishing tools are geared toward preventing or protecting against incoming emails designed to tempt or coerce your customers into giving up credentials or even initiating the transfer of funds. In some cases, anti-phishing tools can act to remediate the damage in the case of a malicious email making through existing protections, tracing additional email traffic generated as a result of an initial compromise and removing emails or initiating maintenance actions on potentially compromised user accounts. Other tools are geared toward protecting customers from malicious email purporting to be from your business brand or executives. Again, these tools can take multiple forms: using standards like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to authenticate legitimate email coming from your domain, or proactively monitoring for malicious email or messages on social media and taking active measures against the sender. Finally, the best defense against phishing is an educated user base. To that end, it can be quite effective to employ a training program to help users be able to effectively triage legitimate or malicious email, and to employ best practices in how to react when they receive a suspicious email. This training program can even be taken so far as to run simulated attacks to measure your response to phishing attacks. Existing email servers or services generally offer a baseline level of protection, but your corporate needs may well warrant expanding your toolset to something that gives you stronger (even AI-based) controls and reporting capabilities. API-based connectivity into your email platform is another key feature, as legacy email protocols are increasingly insecure and subject to authentication attacks. If you’re in the market for training and simulation tools you’ll want to look for solutions that bring some variety. On the training front this should help keep users engaged, particularly if training is required on an annual basis or if more advanced training is required for privileged users or those with higher financial responsibilities. Simulation tools should have the ability to target smaller subsets of users (as a sample size), to minimize the impact on your business operations. A variety of tools are available to help protect your business from the types of threats phishing attacks present your organization. Half the battle is knowing what solutions are available and how they can help protect your business, and thus your employees and customers. Avananoffers anti-phishing software for cloud-hosted email, tying into your email provider using APIs to train their AI using historical email. The service analyzes not just message contents, formatting, and header information, but evaluates existing relationships between senders and receivers to establish a level of trust. Additionally, Avanan can detect suspicious messages in Teams or Slack, both emerging attack vectors. Barracuda Email Protectionis another tool that leverages mail provider APIs to protect against phishing as well asbusiness email compromise (BEC). Barracuda’s offering protects against a range of phishing variants, from spear phishing to impersonation to zero-day phishing attacks. Because compromised email accounts tend to lead to more phishing attempts or further account-based attacks, Barracuda’s focus on minimizing further damage as a result of a successful phishing attempt has more value than relying solely on prevention. Barracuda also provides brand protection and domain fraud prevention through DMARC analysis and reporting. BrandShieldfocuses exclusively on protecting your corporate brand and that of your executives. Identifying phishing attacks (through email, social media, or other mediums) which leverage your brand or the names of your executives is just one component of BrandShield’s portfolio. BrandShield also monitors the internet forrogue websitesusing your brand as well as marketplaces like Amazon where physical counterfeits of your products could pop up for sale. Cofense PDR(phishing detection and response) is a managed service where both AI-based tools and security professionals are leveraged in concert to identify and mitigate phishing attacks as they happen. Managed services can be a good option if you need to maximize the level of protection, as they can be more effective than even hiring a full-time team to handle phishing prevention since the managed services team is able to evaluate threat data from all of the enterprise systems they protect. Outseer FraudAction(formerly RSA FraudAction) offers an extensive list of features that you’d expect from a heavy hitter. The anti-phishing service is a managed service like what Cofense offers, and Outseer brings capabilities like site shutdown, forensics, and active optional countermeasures such as strategically responding to phishing attempts with planted credentials in order to track the attack chain and respond accordingly. IRONSCALESis an email security platform that seeks to strengthen your existing email system through dynamic detection and analysis: blocking, flagging, or simply adding a banner to potentially suspicious email. IRONSCALES also offers end user training, focused on email security and general awareness, which helps strengthen your defense against the core of phishing: the social engineering attack. KnowBe4boasts one of the biggest names in hacking (Kevin Mitnick) as their Chief Hacking Officer. Many of Mitnick’s exploits were centered around social engineering, and their business reflects that by focusing on enabling employees to make better decisions through education. In addition to their top-rated awareness training KnowBe4 also offers PhishER, which is aSecurity Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)platform centered around phishing attempts: enabling your security team to more efficiently respond to email-based threats to your organization. Mimecastoffers several tools for protecting against phishing attempts, including features which detect malicious links and attachments removing them or rendering them safe using advanced methods like sandboxing. Mimecast’s ability to prevent code-based attacks initiated through phishing emails or more sophisticated methods like QR codes by opening links within the Mimecast cloud, simplifying the deployment process and ensuring prevention tools are always updated. Microsoft Defender for Office 365brings similar capabilities as some of the other tools on this list: user training, phishing detection and prevention, forensic and root-cause analysis, and even threat hunting. Because Defender is simply an add-on for Office 365, it’s integrated tightly without having to configure the initial integration. Microsoft also offers preset security policies that you can adjust to your needs; supporting enforcement, the option for users to override, and tracking policy changes over time. This service has special advantages for Office 365 customers, and special disadvantages for everyone else. Valimailshould be of interest even to IT shops with little-to-no budget. Valimail’s DMARC offering walks you through configuring DMARC for your email domains, and then aggregates and generates daily DMARC reports. Gaining this visibility into email authentication can help you rapidly identify additional senders that may be legitimate, potentially add them to your DMARC configuration, and then ramp up enforcement in order to prevent unauthorized email forging your domain. The best part is that Valimail offers several of their DMARC tools for free. The other service Valimail offers is Amplify, which facilitates implementation of theBIMIstandard (Brand Indicators for Message Identification), which adds a corporate logo to email originating from your organization, showing that the sender is authenticated and valid. BIMI not only adds a layer of sophistication to your email config, it enhances trust in emails coming from your domain both for receiving servers and ultimately the recipient.

"Logic bombs explained: Definition, examples, prevention",https://www.csoonline.com/article/510947/logic-bomb.html,"A logic bomb is malicious code that waits for the right time or opportunity to strike. Some infamous examples show the potential for damage. What is a logic bomb? Properties of a logic bomb Are logic bombs viruses? What does a logic bomb attack do? What triggers a logic bomb? Time bomb vs. logic bomb Are logic bombs always malicious? Logic bomb fallout How to detect and prevent logic bomb attacks 4 famous examples of logic bomb attacks Logic bomb code Related content The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time GitHub to unbundle Advanced Security Aptori Now on Google Cloud Marketplace for AI-Powered Security and Automated Risk Remediation Trump nominates cyber vet Sean Plankey for CISA chief amid DOGE cuts and firings Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  A logic bomb is a set of instructions embedded in a software system that, if specified conditions are met, triggers a malicious payload to take actions against the operating system, application, or network. The actual code that does the dirty work, sometimes referred to as slag code,might be a standalone application or be hidden within a larger program. While logic bombs are sometimes delivered via the same techniques that can infect your computer with viruses or other malware, more often they’re planted by insiders with privileged access to the system being attacked — and can therefore be quite tricky to detect. A logic bomb is defined by three characteristics: They are dormant until activated:Logic bombs include instructions (logic) that define when they will be triggered, based on conditions that must be met. As a result, they can remain dormant indefinitely, and thus be very difficult to notice. They contain a malicious payload:Logic bombs include a payload that is responsible for carrying out the malicious action once triggered. They are constructed to detonate when conditions are met:Logic bombs include conditionals that, if met, will set the malicious payload into action. A logic bomb isn’t a virus, but it could be spread by one. Unlike a virus, the distinguishing characteristic of a logic bomb isn’t how it spreads, but how it’s triggered. A quick note on terminology:Malwarecomes in different types, includingviruses,worms, andTrojans, that are generally defined by how they spread and how they infect computers; the details vary, but by and large they are designed to find victims semi-autonomously. The part of the malware that carries out the attack, known as the payload,can work in different ways; some of these payloads themselves are logic bombs. For instance, theStuxnetworm, created by US and Israeli intelligence to sabotage the Iranian nuclear program, has a payload that will activate only if it determines that it’s running on a computer that is part of a specific type of uranium enrichment facility. That said, not all malicious code is malware, and not all logic bombs are delivered via viruses or their kin. In fact, as we’ll see in our examples, many logic bombs are hidden inside ordinary computer programs by the people who wrote those programs themselves. As the Stuxnet example demonstrates, a logic bomb attack gets its name because the malicious code activates when some logical condition, or trigger,is satisfied: It can be explained as an if-then statement. There are two forms a logic bomb’s trigger can take: positive or negative.A positive trigger goes off if something happens, whereas a negative trigger goes off if something failsto happen. Stuxnet is a positive trigger: The worm analyzes the underlying hardware and if it matches the system it was designed to attack, it spins any attached uranium centrifuges fast enough to destroy them. There are other, somewhat more pedestrian types of positive triggers as well: A logic bomb may go off if someone attempts to open a specified file, for instance, or copy data from one directory to another. A negative trigger is best undersood in terms of the sort ofinsider threatswe noted as a common use case for a logic bomb. For instance, a disgruntled employee, suspecting they are about to be fired, may plant a logic bomb on the company servers that will erase valuable corporate data at 10 a.m. unless its creator intervenes. As long as the employee maintains access to the system, they can stop the bomb from going off, which may give them leverage in the dispute with their employer — or at least leave them satisfied that their firing will be followed by chaos once they’re gone. The actual behavior of a logic bomb can range widely. When it comes to the insider threats that make up much of the logic bomb landscape, a few types of attack are particularly common, including file or hard drive deletions, either as a ransom threat or act of revenge, or data exfiltration, as part of a plan to use privileged information in future employment. But truly, the things a logic bomb can do — the thenthat comes after the if—are only limited by the attacker’s skill and imagination. For instance, one enterprising soul managed to hide acryptojackinglogic bomb in public domain Python libraries thatsurreptitiously mined Bitcoin for the attacker’s benefit. A logic bomb can be triggered by whatever specific event or condition its creator desire. Common triggers include: Time-based triggers:Logic bombs can be programmed to activate at a set time in the future. Event-driven triggers:Logic bombs can also be designed to activate when a specific event transpires on the system where it resides, such as when a file is accessed or a particular user logs in or losses access to the system. User-activated triggers:Logic bombs can also be programmed to trigger when a user takes a specific action, such as entering a particular command. Combination triggers:Logic bombs can be designed to go off after a number of conditions are met, spanning any of the above examples. You’ll sometimes see references to time bombs as a type of cyberattack; these are a subset of logic bombs, although some might consider them a closely related attack. A time bomb is a logic bomb whose trigger goes off at a specific time. In some ways, this might be considered the simplest type of logic that can go into a logic bomb. The purpose of writing this kind of trigger can be similar to a real, physical exploding time bomb: To give the attacker enough time to clear out of the area (in this case, the computer or network where the bomb was planted) to make it less likely for them to be affected or fingered as the attacker. The example we gave above of a negative trigger is a more sophisticated variation on the time bomb concept, as its time deadline can be postponed by user action to create a sort of “dead man’s switch.” Logic bombs are, by definition, malicious. The “bomb” in “logic bomb” is of course metaphorical, although in cases like Stuxnet that targetoperational technology, they can wreak havoc on the physical world. But even all-digital logic bombs get that name because they’re destructive. There are, of course, other types of programs that might be superficially similar to logic bombs but not harmful—for instance, a program you’ve downloaded as a free trial might stop working after 15 days. But because you were told that when you downloaded it, that isn’t considered a logic bomb. When triggered, logic bombs can wreak a range of havoc on targeted systems, including the following examples: Data loss and corruption:A logic bomb could be designed to delete specific files or portions of a database, for example. Disruption of operations:A logic bomb can be programmed to modify configurations, disable services, or crash systems, thereby resulting in system downtime. Financial loss:Downtime caused by a logic bomb could result in financial loses, due to missed business opportunities or costs associated with restoring operations. Reputational damage:Loss of customer or partner trust could result from the damage caused by a logic bomb. Data theft:The payloads of logic bombs could be configured to exfiltrate data when triggered, including valuable intellectual property. Regulatory compliance issues:The aftermath of a logic bomb attack can leave organizations facing significant compliance or legal ramifications due to, for example, violations of data protection regulations. Logic bombs are a particularly pernicious type of attack because the attack code by its very nature may lie dormant for an extended period of time. In general, it’s difficult for even the bestendpoint security softwareto sniff out code that isn’t executing. Since some logic bombs are delivered via malware, one way to keep them off your systems is to follow anti-malware best practices: Watch out forphishingemails, and don’t open or download attachments if you’re not absolutely certain where they came from. Similarly, don’t download or install applications unless they come from a trusted source. That includes browser navbars, which are a common malware vector. Keep your computer safe with updated antivirus/endpoint security software. But as we’ve seen, fighting malware isn’t enough to defuse all potential logic bombs. The cryptominers we mentioned above are an example of what’s known as asupply chain attack, in which an organization’sreuse of third-party code(open source libraries, in this case) becomes a problem when that code has a logic bomb hidden within it. And, of course, no antivirus program can protect you from a determined insider threat. The best way to sniff out malicious code that’s being embedded in your own software, either deliberately by a disgruntled employee or inadvertently in the form of a third-party library, is to bake secure coding practices, like those that are part of theDevSecOpsphilosophy, into your development pipeline. These practices are meant to ensure that any code passes security tests before it’s put into production, and would prevent a lone wolf insider attacker from unilaterally changing code in an insecure way. In 1982, a massive explosion disrupted the flow of natural gas in an important pipeline traversing Siberia. For years, a rumor has persisted that this was an act of CIA sabotage. The story goes that U.S. intelligence agents discovered that their Soviet counterparts were attempting to steal the computer code necessary to automate their pipeline from the West, since the native Soviet software industry wasn’t up to the task; so the Americans allowed the Soviets to make off with code with a logic bomb hidden in it that resulted in the destruction of the pipeline. This sabotage has sometimes been called the original logic bomb, although it’s never been confirmed by any of the parties involved, and there’s some evidence that the destruction may have just been the result ofgood old-fashioned incompetence. While we may never know the truth of what happened to that pipeline, there are plenty of well-documented logic bomb attacks: In late 2001, a systems administrator quit his job at UBS and only hours later bought numerous “put” options that would allow him to profit if his former employer’s stock declined by March 15, 2002. The logic bomb he left behindwent off on March 4, damaging numerous systems at UBS. He was caught and sentenced to years in prison, and was forced to pay millions in restitution. In 2003, a sysadmin, fearful that his employer Medco Health Solutions was planning to fire him,planted a logic bomb on their servers that would’ve deleted huge swaths of data. He set it to go off on his birthday in 2004, but it failed due to a programming error, so he changed the trigger date the following year; it was discovered and disabled a few months in advance, and he was sentenced to 30 months in jail. In 2008, a programmer was terminated from his contract job at U.S. mortgage giant Fannie Mae. He managed to plant a logic bomb before his network access was cut off thatwas intended to wipe out all of the company’s data, but the malicious code was discovered and deactivated in time. Fannie Mae programmers traced the malicious script to him through network logs, and by comparing the contents of a directory that he created on his laptop the day he was terminated. Between 2014 and 2016, a contractor working for Siemens in Pennsylvaniaput logic bombs into the spreadsheets that Siemens used to manage orders,which he was then paid to come in and fix, racking up tens of thousands of dollars in fees. The bombs were discovered when he went on vacation and gave the passwords for the spreadsheets to Siemens staff so they could update them while he was out of town. If you’d like to see the code for a simple example of a logic bomb, there’s a GitHub repository for theChristmas Logic Bomb, written in Python. This code is a time bomb that activates on Christmas Day and displays a festive message — it doesn’t do any harm, but it’s a good way to see how this kind of attack works.

Inside the world’s largest ‘live-fire’ cyber-defense exercise,https://www.csoonline.com/article/2518328/inside-the-worlds-largest-live-fire-cyber-defense-exercise.html,"From the Retamares military base in Madrid, CSO Spain receives an inside look at the Spanish team’s headquarters for Locked Shields 2024, a worldwide event for practicing coordination and cooperation in defense of cyberspace. Cooperation, tension, and learning A scenario that could very well be real Related content The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time CIOs and CISOs take on NIS2: Key challenges, security opportunities Aptori Now on Google Cloud Marketplace for AI-Powered Security and Automated Risk Remediation Suite 404: Training executives for cyberattack response in a playful way Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  The island country of Berylia is under threat. Over the next 48 hours, it will be subject to an endless number of cyberattacks without interruption, which it must contain in the best way possible. Although the country is prepared, the scenario is far from ideal, as it is engaged in an open dispute over territorial waters with Crimsonia, which has even dared to invade part of its borders. The hostile activities are now directed at Berylia’s essential services connected to the Internet. It is around 11 a.m. on April 25 at the Retamares Base in Pozuelo de Alarcón (Madrid), and journalists are preparing to witness how this country is preparing to protect its systems in “an exercise that is unparalleled in terms of size and characteristics,” in the words of Enrique Pérez de Tena, who, as head of the international relations, communications, and media for the Spanish Joint Cyberspace Command (MCCE), is accompanying us on this visit. Berylia and Crimsonia are fictional countries and what Pérez de Tena is referring to is Locked Shields 2024, a test that the NATO Cooperative Cyber ​​Defence Centre of Excellence has carried out every year since 2010 — and which the CCDCOE calls ”the most advanced live-fire cyber defense practice in the world.” “When people experience it, they don’t want anything else. They have the opportunity to carry out activities that they don’t have access to in their daily lives,” says Pérez de Tena as we walk through the venue. “It’s like when a fighter plane launches missiles.” In this edition of Locked Shields, Pérez de Tena explains, three divisions have been organized for the occasion, the objective of each being to defend the 18 regions of Berylia that are being attacked from another group of teams organized in Tallinn, Estonia, the central venue of the event. As part of the exercise, each town on the island of Berylia has its own action team, and all have the same critical infrastructures to defend, ranging from nuclear power plants and banking systems to satellites and electricity distribution plants. In short, they contain “everything that could be attractive to cybercriminals,” Pérez de Tena says. The test is known in cybersecurity circles asRed Team vs. Blue Team, and this year nearly 4,000 people are taking part. The team here in Spain is “played” by around 200 experts made up of 40% military personnel from the MCCE, Land, Sea and Air, who are supported by soldiers from Portugal, Brazil and Chile; and 60% civilians, from the MCCE itself and from private companies that put their talent at the disposal of these events. At the end of the two days, the CCDCOE makes a classification of the more than 40 countries that have participated, among which include non-NATO countries, such as Japan. This year, Spain has settled in the middle of the pack, while Latvia and tandems from Finland-Poland and Estonia-France have stood out. Regardless of standing, both the CCDCOE and the MCCE emphasize the “collaborative” and “learning” nature of the exercise over competition. What’s more, as Pérez de Tena explains, “it also helps us to put faces to the situation. To know that someone is a great expert in a certain tool or system. In this way, if I have a problem, I know I can count on them.” Enrique Pérez de Tena speaks with COMPUTERWORLD spain during ‘Locked Shields 2024.’ Juan Márquez During our tour of the exercise, we take in the hustle and bustle, as well as the tense calm that occasionally takes over the Retamares hub. But we assume that our media visit coincides with a period in which less serious incidents are taking place, at least not ones that would cause panic among the professionals. First, we approach the communications and legal groups. Calmly, Pérez de Tena introduces us to a team, the one he himself directs: experts in crisis management. “Imagine that what we have in front of us are members of the Presidency of the Government or other ministries,” he says, to frame the situation. “How should they deal with, for example, a press conference? … We even manage a web page with simulated social networks in which content is posted; some false and some real. Our job is to compare everything and communicate.” In the same room, a group of professionals from the legal team debate heatedly. “There are even tax professors,” Pérez de Tena says. “In war, decisions have to be made with many connotations.” These participants give the green light to certain actions according to the various conventions, he adds. “Is this in accordance with the Geneva Convention? Go ahead with it,” he says by way of example. Before moving on to the stage where technicians are defending Berylia, we head to a large tent shroud in silence. This is the center that coordinates communications and legal with the hackers. Here, they receive input on everything that is being concocted. After that short detour, we arrive at the nerve center of the exercise, and meet some cybersecurity “cracks” that we are not allowed to name and finally come upon the teams tasked with protecting Berylia’s various regions. “The attackers have an advantage because they have had time to prepare,” says Pérez de Tena. “For us it is as if it were doing our daily work.” In addition, he says, “there is no set time for incidents to be launched. People have to realize that cyberspace has no borders. It is a playing field for anyone who has a device.” Is this exercise itself also a target for cybercriminals? “Of course,” Pérez de Tena replies. “But we have the best [defenders] here, right now. … If someone manages to get in, we’ll all go home and change professions,” he jokes. All this fiction could very well unfold in real life, as the fact is, we find ourselves in a permanent state of cyberwar. “The color of our cap is grey because we are constantly in that zone that exists between war and peace ,” says Pérez de Tena, adding that in Spain we can be relatively calm. “We are doing well, we are highly regarded internationally, and luckily we are not currently the target of the main incidents. But the tables can turn at any time.” As for the impact of AI, Pérez de Tena does not believe it will be more relevant in this battle than “any other technological development that has occurred.” Hybrid warfare has always existed and its main problem today is attribution. “Faced with the difficulty of obtaining expert evidence to bring a person, organization, or state before the International Court, countries are making political attributions. For example, a foreign minister says: I know [this attack] was you, and if you continue like this, I will [retaliate],” Pérez de Tena says. Still, Pérez de Tena reiterates that cooperation is key and that “we learn from our mistakes.” “We are not aware of how cheap it is to protect ourselves and how expensive it can be if we do not. But 100% cybersecurity does not exist,” he says, adding that, in warfare, MCCE is not a substitute for an airplane, frigate, or tank. “We are just another tool. One that will also allow them to do their job.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time CIOs and CISOs take on NIS2:

How cybercriminals recruit insiders for malicious acts,https://www.csoonline.com/article/653481/coming-from-inside-the-building-dark-web-recruitment-of-malicious-insiders.html,"Criminal attackers view your employees as potential accomplices to transform into insider threats. Here’s who they target, how they recruit them, and what they want malicious insiders to do to help compromise IT systems. Recruiting insiders Most targeted industries Insider threats: Telecom industry Insider Threats: Retail Sector Insider Threats: Shipping and logistics Insider Threats: Social media Insider Threats: Financial services Insider Threats: Government and military Defending Against Insider Threats Related content US charges 12 Chinese hackers in major government-backed espionage campaign Microsoft files lawsuit against LLMjacking gang that bypassed AI safeguards Fake captcha attacks are increasing, say experts Authorities seize Phobos and 8Base ransomware servers, arrest 4 suspects Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  The road to a successful cyberattack often leads through an organization’s employees. After all, they already have authenticated access, sometimes to highly sensitive data, as well as intimate knowledge of the organization and its people, processes, and technology. Sometimes employees can be used unwittingly, for example, if they are tricked or persuaded into providing access usingsocial engineering tactics. Other times, insiders knowingly partner with external attackers, selling access or data for cash. Insider threats have impacted a number of worldwide brands — one of the most noteworthy beinga large healthcare firmwhere an employee stole data belonging to more than 500,000 customers from its CRM system and attempted to sell it on the dark web. Similarly, in 2021, authorities charged an employee at a large telecom company forproviding SIM swapsto threat actors for $500 apiece. Insiders can also willingly share sensitive and proprietary data when motivated by ideological reasons. Recently,two Tesla employees leaked dataabout self-driving features to a German newspaper. The shared data also included personal information of over 75,000 Tesla customers. Considering that thedeep and dark webare anonymous by design, it is a fitting venue for those seeking to find malicious insiders. Upon investigation, we at Cybersixgill were not disappointed. The following report discusses our findings and details how organizations can protect themselves from a broad variety of insider threats. Attacks harnessing insiders are often carried out over time, with the insider usually taking steps to hide their activity and remain undetected. This approach is attractive to threat actors because it can have a high impact and a relatively low cost to execute. Contract staff, IT admins, individual contributors, lawyers, academics, and senior executives whether they be third-party contractors, current, or past employees could all play the role of a malicious insider for attackers to recruit. There are two common groups that criminal organizations gravitate towards: Those with elevated privileges with regard to access or managing systems Those who may be motivated financially, such as those in lower wage brackets, to help out Human behavior is difficult to predict, but it is very rare for somebody to join a company with the intention of becoming an insider. Employees, however, can be persuaded to work on behalf of a threat actor in response to a cultural change at the company or a change within their own personal circumstance. Some individuals can also be motivated by greed, anger, or ideology. When recruiting insiders, threat actors use various tactics, including blackmail and other coercive techniques to extort the information they need from an employee. From our findings, however, the majority of insiders on the dark web are recruited by financial rewards. In most cases, threat actors want to keep the number of observables to a minimum and enable remote access as quickly as possible. This makes it easier to recruit an insider and minimize the risk of getting caught. Our investigations found hundreds of posts on underground forums and Telegram during 2023, in which actors sought malicious insiders across many industries and for a variety of purposes. These include some of the world’s largest companies such as Amazon, Meta, Walmart, Chase, PayPal, AT&T, and Verizon. While not all postings state the desired function of the insider, the ones that do fall into the following broad categories (roughly ranked from most to least common): In general, financial services are the most targeted industry on the dark web, since actors are financially motivated. But when it comes to insider fraud, financial services are far lower down the list. There two key reasons for this: Bank employees have relatively higher salaries, and sanctions for fraudulent activities are far more severe, so they might be less inclined to risk termination and legal action. Because the stakes of fraudulent financial transactions are higher than, for example, retail fraud, banks invest considerably in vetting employees and embedding anti-fraud measures, such as requiring multiple sign-off on some transactions and automated flagging of suspicious activities. Telecom is the most popular industry for which underground threat actors solicit insiders. The purpose is generally clear: Telecom employees can facilitate “SIM swaps,” a tactic in which the attacker causes the victim’s phone number to be ported to a SIM card in their possession. Once the attacker controls the victim’s phone number, they can carry out a number of attacks, such as intercepting one-time passwords sent via SMS or taking over cryptowallets tied to the number. Porting a phone number is a routine business procedure carried out by store employees. Thus, finding someone to execute an unauthorized port might be relatively easy: It could involve approaching an employee, offering payment, and even showing some fake IDs to grant plausible deniability. There is a considerable quantity of underground posts discussing insiders for performing SIM swaps. In the image below an actor seeking an insider at a Verizon store to perform SIM swapping. Cybersixgill Telegram is the most popular venue for actors to seek telecom insiders, also referred to asinnys.In the examples below, threat actors seek SIM swaps through insiders at organizations including T-Mobile, AT&T, Metro and Verizon. Cybersixgill Cybersixgill Cybersixgill Occasionally, the post’s author will even state how much they will pay for swaps, such as this author (below), who offers $1,200 apiece. Cybersixgill This actor, who charges $2,000 per swap, offers proof of working with an insider, including a screenshot of AT&T’s employee portal and DMs with the insider. Cybersixgill In addition to SIM swapping, underground actors also seek telecom insiders for credentials, customer data, and general information. In the images below you’ll first see an actor on an underground forum seeking Vodafone insiders to provide customer data. Then an actor seeks telecom insiders in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Uzbekistan. Folowed by an actor that seeks a Claro Colombia employee to answer some questions. Cybersixgill Cybersixgill Cybersixgill Sometimes we find insiders reaching out. For example, this self-described “disgruntled telecom employee” is offering to sell information regarding eSIMs, which will enable porting numbers with nothing more than running “a script in the cloud.” Cybersixgill Underground threat actors typically seek retail insiders to receive goods for free. One common scheme in which they can involve insiders is refund fraud, also known asrefunding, in which an actor claims undeserved refunds for a product. There are many techniquesto carry out this type of attack, including reporting that an empty box or damaged item arrived or returning an empty box. However, most methods require convincing an employee to accept the story; it is easier to carry out a fake return if they are already a willing accomplice. Some threat actors state quite plainly that they are seeking insiders for refund scams. In the examples below, one actor offers $5,000 for an insider responsible for returns at Walmart or any other retailer, while another offers an undisclosed sum to insiders who work with them. Cybersixgill Cybersixgill Other actors are not as explicit about wanting an insider to assist with refund scams. For example, the actor in the post below sought an Amazon insider, preferably a customer support supervisor. Someone in this role would be able to authorize returns. Cybersixgill Threat actors also recruit insiders in e-commerce. For example, this actor seeks eBay insiders who can unblock suspended accounts. Cybersixgill Another actor persistently sought insiders at lego.com to provide information about orders, posting eight times in two months. However, in many postings, there are few, if any, clues about why an insider is requested, though we may presume that they are related to theft. One actor seeks an Amazon warehouse worker; another seeks an Amazon India employee who can assist with bulk orders, and another seeks associates at a long and varied list of companies to help with “customer lookups,” to provide sensitive and confidential customer data. Cybersixgill Cybersixgill Cybersixgill Underground threat actors recruit insiders in shipping and logistics primarily to execute fraudulent tracking scans. Just like in the example below where an actor seeks an insider at UPS and other couriers to perform scans. Cybersixgill Insider scans are another technique in refund scams. In this scheme, an actor requests to return an item to an e-commerce store. An accomplice in the shipping company scans the shipping label, confirming to the retailer that the item is in transit. The retailer issues a refund but never receives the package. Fraudsters can also use insider scans and courier insiders to simply “ship” a package that disappears, allowing them to claim insurance for their losses. The examples below show how malicious actors go about performing these scams. In one image an actor seeking insider scans at UPS, DHL, and other carriers to assist with refund scams and in the following an actor looking for employees at UPS, FedEx, USPS or other couriers. Cybersixgill Cybersixgill Many posts recruiting courier insiders, such as the example below, offer “big money” to malicious employees. Cybersixgill Others offer insider scans as a service such as the post below, requesting $60 per scan at FedEx, UPS, Royal Mail, and other couriers. Cybersixgill Threat actors target insiders at social media companies to ban, un-ban and access customer data. The examples below show how one actor on Telegram claimed to be “paying good” for someone at Instagram or X (formerly Twitter), and another offered “$$$$$$” for someone at Snapchat. Cybersixgill Cybersixgill If the post specifies the function of the desired insider, it generally has to do with banning, unbanning, or verifying accounts. In addition to this, actors also seek social media employees to provide a user’s personal information. Cybersixgill Cybersixgill Cybersixgill Cybersixgill An insider at a bank or other financial services company might be the necessary link to execute a large, fraudulent scheme. Underground actors use insiders at banks to approve payments and money transfers, enabling fraudsters to move and launder money. In the next example, an actor claims to have an insider at Metro, Santander, and Barclays that can approve payments of up to £90,000-£200,000 (depending on the bank). The actor notes that these payments appear legitimate and do not burn the account. Cybersixgill In this next example, an actor claims to have a Bank of America insider onboard. The actor is seeking account and routing information, as well as mobile phone numbers, in order to carry out their scheme. Cybersixgill Insiders also allegedly assist with “loading,” an activity involving moving money to an account in the actor’s control. Cybersixgill Similarly, actors seek to use insiders for money conversions. The example below is from an actor expecting to receive $10,000-$30,000 each day from a “project” and seeks a PayPal employee to convert it into cryptocurrency. Cybersixgill Actors also seek bank insiders with access to the SWITCH application server. Cybersixgill In this next post, the actor even notes that they seek to deploy the FASTCASH malware. FASTCASH malware can be used to cause ATMs to eject their cash, and it was originally identified with Hidden Cobra, a North Korean advanced persistent threat (APT). Whether these posts’ authors have any connection to the group is uncertain, however, if they succeed in gaining access to the SWITCH application server, they stand to generate very significant cash payouts. Cybersixgill Transcending from cybercrime to espionage, we discovered several posts in which actors solicited governmental or government-affiliated insiders to provide information. This includes individuals, like in the image below, who can provide national citizen databases to assist in doxing. An actor seeking an insider in the French government to provide citizen data. Cybersixgill Other posts seek individuals who can provide classified information. For example, this next post appeared several times across several forums and Telegram from a self-described “intelligence analysis corporation” offering $1,000-$2,000 as a finders fee for someone that can connect them with an insider at a US military contractor. Cybersixgill Finally, we also discovered the below post in which an individual purported to sell sixteen sets of classified government data, including proprietary data belonging to defense manufacturers such as Raytheon and Elbit. The post also lists a secret document about a confidential Five Eyes military exercise for $300, noting that it was obtained by an insider. Cybersixgill We must emphasize that posts soliciting insiders to provide classified information are rare. The penalties for such activities are severe, and most of the dark web’s users are financially motivated. Even so, it is not unheard of for an insider to leak classified information on the deep and dark web; most recently, a Massachusetts National Guardsman has beencharged with posting classified documentson a Discord server. Employees can pose a unique type of threat to an organization. Most employees are not malicious, and they ought to be trusted with access to the data and systems needed for performing their tasks. However, those who are lured by a variety of methods to use their positions to assist in criminal enterprises can cause significant financial and reputational damage to their employers. According to the 2023 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, malicious insiders perpetrate about 19% of known data breaches. While there is no way of knowing for sure how many of these attacks originated from a partnership forged on the deep and dark web, there are several practices that companies can take to protect themselves. Principal of least privilege: Employee privileges should be limited only to what their tasks require. Job rotation: Regular cycling of employees between tasks to reveal fraudulent activity. Multiple signoff: Execution of sensitive actions should require multiple employees to approve. VIP account protection: Customers with sensitive accounts or who are more likely to be targeted should be able to opt-in to more stringent account protection. Employee awareness: Employees should understand that threat actors seek to recruit their peers and perpetrate fraud. If they see something suspicious, they should report it. Automated detection: Use of software to flag suspicious activities. Underground monitoring: Organizations must understand adversarial efforts to recruit insiders. Real-time cyber threat intelligence from the clear, deep, and dark web is essential to gather the information needed to expose organizational risk from insider threats. A rogue employee can severely impact a business’s operations, finances, network security, and brand. They are far more than just an “IT problem” or even a “security team problem.” A proper organizational defense requires coordination between technical and non-technical players, from the SOC to HR, in order to keep the company secure. Organizations must identify which of their employees are in roles that might be targeted for recruitment by cybercriminals, and enforce stringent monitoring and controls to neutralize any threats from inside the building.

How attackers evade your EDR/XDR system — and what you can do about it,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3476179/how-your-xdr-is-evaded.html,"Attackers make a living evading your EDR/XDR systems. Here’s how they get around or go undetected by your defenses at three key points along the way. How attackers evade XDR during observation How attackers evade XDR during detection How attackers evade XDR during response and prevention Documentation Related content Chinese cyberespionage group deploys custom backdoors on Juniper routers Chinese APT Silk Typhoon exploits IT supply chain weaknesses for initial access The risks of standing down:  Why halting US cyber ops against Russia erodes deterrence Chinese cyber espionage growing across all industry sectors Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  A recent global survey noted that CISOs and their organizations may betoo reliant on endpoint detection and response (EDR) and extended detection and response (XDR) systems, as attackers are increasingly evading them. That’s due in part to the fact that evading EDR/XDR systems has been and will continue to be a fundamental requirement for most modern adversaries. “Evasion” has been used generically to describe instances where a defensive response has not been observed. While technically accurate, this lack of specificity hinders cybersecurity professionals from accurately targeting remediation efforts. For example, the fix for faulty detection logic differs greatly from instances where telemetry is missing in an XDR platform. To better understand how attacks evadeEDR/XDR systemsand, more importantly, what to do after it happens, we need to understand the three areas where it occurs: observation, detection, and response and prevention. At its core, anXDR systemconsumes events from various sources, such as an endpoint’s operating system or a cloud provider. These events, commonly referred to as telemetry, form the foundation of detections. An XDR can only detect what the system(s) can provide and collect. The first type of evasion occurs when the XDR does not receive the events it needs to detect malicious behavior. There are a few common causes for this type of evasion. First, and what I believe to be the “purest” technical evasion, is that the adversary’s actions created no relevant telemetry.Relevantbecause every action taken on a system generates some amount of telemetry, but those events might not be useful for creating good detections. Think of this as a missing event source in the system rather than a deficiency in the XDR. Next are instances where the telemetry is produced by the system but not consumed by the XDR. There are thousands of event sources to which an XDR can subscribe, and vendors’ jobs are to decide which ones are required to meet their detection requirements. For example, if an XDR vendor is particularly interested in detecting behaviors related to Active Directory, they would prioritize collecting events from AD over something like network traffic. Not collecting certain types of events, whether by choice or ignorance, creates an exploitable gap in the XDR’s coverage of certain techniques. Last, an adversary may actively interfere with an XDR agent such that events are not sent to the centralized server in charge of collection and correlation. This interference comes in many forms, including stopping or uninstalling the agent, blocking communication with the server (e.g., via host-based firewall modifications), or tampering with sensors (e.g., disabling AMSI). Generally speaking, these represent failures of the XDR developer. If an attack is missed because the agent does not collect the relevant telemetry, the vendor is the only entity that can remediate the failure as it involves adding new telemetry sources or extending/enriching existing ones. In the event of agent interference, the vendor should implement anti-tampering measures to prevent what they can and detect interference that can’t reasonably be prevented. These issues are the most difficult to address for every security team because there’s nothing they can realistically do other than appeal to their XDR vendor. When most people talk about evading XDR, they’re almost always referring to subverting the detection logic in the XDR. Detections themselves are simply ways of evaluating an event, or group of events, to determine if some condition that may be indicative of malicious behavior is present. These detection queries or rules can be precise, meaning they target a specific attribute usually unique to a piece of malware or offensive tool (such as the command line arguments for Mimikatz), or robust, meaning that they target behaviors shared by more than one malware sample or tool. Both types of detections have their faults. Precise detections are prone to evasion because they are often overly specific, meaning that any modification to the target sample would result in a false negative. An example of this would be an attacker patching Mimikatz’s argument strings to turn “sekurlsa::logonpasswords” into “nothings::happening_here,” breaking the brittle detection logic targeting the attacker-controlled string. Robust detections, despite appearing less susceptible to evasion at face value, are notorious for their false positives, which lead to exclusions in the rule that become exploitable by attackers. An example of this that I’ve seen in practice is excluding the Chrome update process, “GoogleUpdate.exe,” from credential dumping detections because its normal operation involves opening a privileged handle to the local security authority subsystem service (LSASS) process. This exclusion allows an attacker to either masquerade as the update helper or inject into it to extract credentials without detection, despite all the behavioral patterns being present in the events collected by the XDR. These evasions exploit logical issues in the detections built into the EDR, whether they are supplied by the vendor or written by internal detection engineers. Imperfect understanding of the technique or procedure, detection chokepoints, compromises made to make the detection viable for production use, and suboptimal telemetry in the XDR leading to weak detection logic are commonplace in the world of endpoint protection. The fix for these issues is to close these logical gaps, but unfortunately, that’s not always possible in real environments. Sometimes we have to accept a certain level of brittleness to generate detections for emerging threats quickly, but these precise detections should be supplemented with robust counterparts to catch the false negatives that inevitably fall through the cracks. Robust detections almost always require some level of exclusions to avoid inundating security teams with alerts, but those exclusions should be limited as much as possible and continuously evaluated to determine if they need to remain in production. Realistically, there is a never-ending tuning and tinkering phase of detection engineering that begins as soon as a detection enters production, where the goal is solely to make the detection as resilient as possible while also remaining within the bounds of what your team can tolerate, both in terms of false positives and false negatives. The last type of evasion centers around a fault in the investigative process that should occur when a true positive alert occurs. The process of responding to an alert varies from organization to organization, but all generally include triage, investigation, and response stages. The complexity of this process opens many different failure points. Working through the pipeline of an average SOC, the first opportunity for evasion to occur is in the triage stage, where a level 1 analyst receives the alert and mistakenly tags it as a false positive. This causes the behavior to go unnoticed despite the XDR doing its job. This failure can stem from alert fatigue, leading to incorrect suppression just to fight the alert queue down, or from a general lack of understanding of what the purpose of the detection is and what the information means. Fixing this failure point typically involves queue and fatigue management through the reduction of false positives (which has its issues, as detailed in the previous section), and through better documentation and education about the detections analysts encounter. Next, the investigative stage, which occurs after a true positive alert is raised, involves secondary information collection to more concretely determine if an alert is worthy of promotion to a full-on incident. This process is typically manual, requiring a skilled analyst to interrogate the system(s) in question and extract supporting information, such as information about artifacts left on the filesystem. There are many failure points here relating to both the skill of the investigator and the adversary. What happens if the analyst needs to check a file on disk, but the adversary has removed it pre-emptively? What if memory forensics are needed, but the adversary has rebooted the system? What if the adversary employed a technique with which the investigator is unfamiliar, causing them to miss tracks left behind by the attacker? Resolving these failure points requires strong supporting documentation, such as what should be collected in the event of a suspected true positive alert and what that information means. Finally, the response stage, which happens after the alert has been confirmed to be a true positive and an incident has been declared, involves the eviction of the threat actor. After determining the scope of the incident (how many systems, users, etc. are involved), security teams have many options to clear the attacker out, ranging from simply rebooting the host to clear out memory-resident malware to drastic measures like burning down their entire environment. Ultimately, success is binary here — either the adversary was fully evicted or not. The biggest mistake I’ve encountered in this stage while in a red team is when the defense team improperly scoped the incident, leading to incomplete eviction and allowing us to persist in the environment for nearly 18 months (we were eventually kicked out only when the server on which we persisted was decommissioned by their IT team as part of a tech lifecycle upgrade process). Improving the response process to reduce an adversary’s chances of evading eviction comes down to having solid processes that have been rehearsed, the ability to identify the whole scope of the compromise, and the ability to validate the complete eradication of the adversary. Describing XDR evasion with sufficient granularity allows us to better identify which component of our detection pipeline failed and, more importantly, what we can do to fix it. Most evasions can be grouped into either observation (whether the XDR saw the malicious behavior), detection (whether the XDR positively identified the behavior as malicious), or response (whether the behavior led to an adequate response by the security team). During your next encounter with evasion, push for more descriptive language to be used and see what improvements to your remediation process can be made.

And this is the biggest show on Earth, not just in sport but probably the biggest event on Earth. So you know it’s going to be the target for disruption by people for a variety of reasons,” says Richard Thurston, research manager of European security services at IDC. There were 450 million cyberattacks against the COVID-delayed Tokyo summer games in 2021, according to Cisco, the network infrastructure provider for the Paris games. Ciscoexpects eight times more attacksto target the Paris Olympics (running July 26 to August 11) and Paralympics (happening August 28 to September 8). AnIDC research reportreleased ahead of the games suggests “Paris 2024 will see the highest potential for cyber disruption in history.” IDC goes on to call these “the most connected Olympic games ever” with “the most complex threat landscape” and “the highest degree of ease for threat actors to execute attacks.” Much of that ease is courtesy of artificial intelligence, since Paris is hosting the first Olympics of the generative AI era. GenAI has already been used in a sophisticated online smear campaign against the games. In 2023, Russian disinformation collective Storm-1679 created an AI-generated video starring a deepfake of Hollywood star Tom Cruise.The video, “Olympics Has Fallen” (a churlish nod to the 2013 action thriller “Olympus Has Fallen”), used a deepfake of Cruise’s image and voice to disparage the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in the run up the Paris games. Cybercriminals are also weaponizing AI formalvertisingandSEO poisoningbefore and during the Olympics, warns Ashley Jess, senior intelligence analyst at Intel 471. “I just saw last week that someone was sharing how to use ChatGPT to build websites that optimize a search engine with your malicious website at the top [of search results]. It was leveraging hundreds of websites at the same time to do it,” says Jess. This AI-based tactic could also be used to build fake Olympics ticketing websites and send those sites to the top of online searches for Paris games tickets, she adds. To hamper ticket fraud, Paris organizers have designated only one website for legitimate ticket sales,tickets.paris2024.org. As of June, however, French authorities had already identified 338 fraudulent Olympics ticket sites on the web. Cybercriminals motivated by greed will use Olympic-themed emails and websites as clickbait to launch money-making exploits such asphishingandransomwareattacks. Hacktivists, on the other hand, may target the Paris games motivated by political and social causes. Current geopolitical conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza could make the 2024 summer Olympics particularly ripe for hacktivist attacks. “A hacktivist will most likely do website defacement or denial of service attacks against the infrastructure that supports the event, mostly to embarrass the host country or the organization,” says Sami Khoury, head of the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), the Canadian equivalent of ANSSI. “They’ll take advantage of the opportunity because there will be billions of people watching the Olympics.” “Hacktivism is not just going to be against the Olympic infrastructure,” Khoury continues. “In the context of the Paris Olympics, it could be against France, but it could also be against other countries and governments who support Ukraine.” During the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, DDoS attacks by the hacktivist collective Anonymous struck down various Brazilian government websites, a digital protest against police and military raids in Rio’s impoverished favelas. This summer’s Paris games are also a prime target for state-sponsored cyber espionage. Like hacktivism, it has a political motive; unlike hacktivism, it’s always coordinated, funded, or sanctioned by a particular government. TheCCCS issued a bulletinin May warning about the risk of cyber espionage at large global sporting events. It noted that Russia’s ban from several international sports organizations — including the IOC and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) — following the invasion of Ukraine could prompt the Kremlin to back retaliatory cyber espionage. A cyber espionage operation at the Rio Olympics unfolded like something out of a James Bond movie. When an official from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) logged into WADA’s database using the Wi-Fi at his Rio hotel, hackers stole his login credentials. Weeks later, the Russian cyber espionage group Fancy Bear publicly posted the confidential WADA medical records of more than 125 athletes who had competed in Rio, including American gymnast Simone Biles and tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams. The French government’s national cybersecurity agency, Agence national de la sécurité des systèmes d’information (ANSSI), is overseeing the monumental effort to keep the Paris Olympics cyber safe. Since mid-2023 it has held several awareness-raising seminars and crisis-planning exercises with multiple stakeholders across the government, security, and sports ecosystems. Eviden (a division of Atos, the lead IT integrator for the games) is managing Paris Olympics cybersecurity services and operations, “which can be delivered from a dedicated SOC for the games, as well as up to 17 SOCs worldwide,” according to the IDC report. It’s a far cry from the jaw dropping gaffe made by Japan’s cybersecurity minister ahead of the 2020 Tokyo summer Olympics. Just two years before the games were scheduled to be held, Yoshitaka Sakurada admittedhe didn’t use computersand seemed confused about how USB drives work. Despite years of planning, anything can happen right up until the eleventh hour. Just before the opening ceremonies of the 2018 winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea,Russian state sponsored hackersunleashed a malware attack dubbed Olympic Destroyer. It knocked out the official Olympics website and stadium Wi-Fi, wreaked havoc with broadcast operations and the on-site news media center, and prevented some spectators from entering the ceremonies when tickets couldn’t be printed off. The Paris games have already had their own near brush with cyber disaster. While some banks, airlines, and media outlets around the world suffered outages to their Microsoft-based systems after afaulty CrowdStrike update on July 19, Paris organizers said theimpact on Olympics operations was minimaland limited to the delivery of some uniforms and accreditations. Though the CrowdStrike incident wasn’t a malicious cyberattack, it throws the issue ofthird-party riskinto the Olympic spotlight. Even if ANSSI successfully fends off cyberattacks directly targeting this summer’s games, the Paris Olympics could still be disrupted if a malicious cyber strike takes out one of its IT providers somewhere along the daisy chain. “Basically, you have third-party software that’s part of the infrastructure and clouds for [Olympics] telecommunications or security or ordering processing. If they go down or they’re attacked, that can have a ripple effect that’s very, very large,” says Eugene Spafford, executive director emeritus at Purdue University’s Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security (CERIAS). Spafford says the most immediate risk is to the IT infrastructure of “organizations that are connected to what’s going on in Paris or around the Olympics in some way.” That includes direct suppliers and partners of the event, plus hotels and other tourism businesses catering to the 10 to 15 million people expected to visit France during the games. IDC’s Thurston, however, urges cybersecurity teams worldwide to recognize that the Paris games heighten the level of cyber risk well beyond the perimeter of Paris, France, or the Olympics themselves. Besides the proliferation of Olympic-themed phishing, malware, and ransomware, he points out that cybersecurity teams in every country and industry may be short-staffed due to summer vacations. On top of that, 24-hour coverage of the Olympics on TV and social media could hurt the ability of line of business employees to sidestep cyber scams and hackers. “Employees might be streaming something about the Olympics or might be looking at the web coverage while they’re working at the same time,” says Thurston. “Sometimes security slips at those moments. That’s why organizations just have to be cognizant of those threats that might change during the Olympic period.” If the Paris games do go off without a major cybersecurity hitch, no one behind the scenes will climb onto the podium for a medal. But silence, in that case, would truly be golden. Tips for SOC teams around the world during the heightened cyber risk period of the Paris Olympics: Monitor geopolitical events and be aware of how they might make your organization (or your partners and suppliers) the target of an Olympic-related hacktivist cyberattack that could have a ripple effect on your IT systems, says Intel 471’sJess. Be extra vigilant of cyberthreats if your business or organization has any relationship with companies playing key roles in the Olympics supply chain, IDC’s Thurston says. Performtabletop exercisesor other tests of your backup plans, fallback services, fallback servers, and hot spares to make sure they work as intended, Purdue’s Spafford notes. Raise awarenessacross your organization of Olympic related phishing, clickbait, scams, and fraud campaigns and how they work, Spaffordadds. Ensure your Internet-facing infrastructure and operating systems are up to date and patched, and all staff are using strong passwords withMFA, advises CCCS’ Khoury. If your company is directly tied to the games as a supplier or partner, don’t let your guard down at night or on weekends during the games; cyber incidents are more likely to happen during the 9 to 5 time zone of the Paris games rather than your own time zone, Khouryadds.

6 hot cybersecurity trends — and 2 going cold,https://www.csoonline.com/article/564860/hot-cybersecurity-trends.html,"Artificial intelligence is altering not only the threat landscape but also how security teams can defend their organizations. But AI isn’t the only trend cybersecurity pros should be on top of. Hot: Use of AI for evil Hot: Use of AI for good Cold: Security tool sprawl Hot: Cybersecurity talent demand Hot: Mergers and acquisitions Cold: Siloed security  Hot: Extortion Hot: Attacks against IoT Related content Polyglot files used to spread new backdoor Top 5 ways attackers use generative AI to exploit your systems New phishing campaign targets users in Poland and Germany Microsoft Teams vishing attacks trick employees into handing over remote access Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  In the world of cybersecurity, as everywhere else, AI and generative AI are top of mind. Malicious actors are using AI and genAI to create more insidious malware, more convincing phishing emails, and more realistic deepfakes. At the same time, vendors are fighting back by incorporating AI capabilities into their cybersecurity tools. The goal is to aggregate and analyze large amounts of threat intelligence data to spot trends, expose vulnerabilities, and identify new attack vectors. GenAI empowers security practitioners to query the data in real-time for faster incident detection and response. Our list of hot trends starts with AI — but doesn’t end there. Here’s a sampling of some of the hottest trends in cybersecurity, along with a couple that are not-so-hot. Threat actors have been quick to exploit thepower of AI technology for nefarious purposes, withgenerative AI fueling a significant risein cyberattacks, whilepushing remediation costs upandimproving their own productivityto boot. Threats from AI fall into several categories.Deloitte’sannualCybersecurity Threat Trendsreport highlights the following AI-fueled threats for 2024: Deepfakes:Threat actors are using AI to generatedeepfake videosthat uselifelike images to impersonate a trusted source. In this scenario, the video might pose as a corporate executive or supervisor to trick a target employee into sending money to a fake account. Or it could impersonate an IT employee to trick end users into revealing passwords and other credentials. Cybercriminals are still seeking viable business models for deepfakes, and as more commodity deepfake-creation tools come online,the threat will expand. Phishing:Remember thosecrude phishing attemptsthat had grammatical mistakes and clumsy wording? AI-generated phishing emails correct those flaws and enable hackers towrite sophisticated and convincing emails quicklyand at scale. Vishing:A variation on phishing, bad actors can use AI to clone a person’s voice for the purposes of financial fraud and unauthorized access to protected systems. Malware:AI enables threat actors to generate and deployever more sophisticated and effective types of malware. “AI is the hottest trend to hit the cybersecurity industry,” says Richard Stiennon, chief research analyst at IT-Harvest. According to Stiennon, vendors, including a new generation of startups, are incorporating large language models (LLMs) into their products to allow users to talk to their own data and derive insights. “There is no question that LLMs are good at interpreting and translating text and will thus assist in threat hunting, anomaly detection, and incident response,” he adds. The most popular deployment model today is the use of AI-based systems in a co-pilot or advisory role, with a human providing oversight and making the final call. However, cybersecurity expert Daniel Miessler says the use of autonomous AI SOC agents that emulate human agents isn’t far off. In fact, a number of startups, including Dropzone.ai and Salem Cyber, are offering pre-trained SOC agents that can replicate human agents and automatically investigate alerts. Dustin Sachs, chief technologist and senior director of programs at the CyberRisk Alliance, adds that organizations with staffing issues and skills gap challenges can take advantage of AI to augment security teams and drive operational efficiency. In this way, genAI is alreadyhelping entry-level SOC analystsimprove their skills. Tech futurist Bernard Marr sums it up this way: “If cyberattack and defense in 2024 is a game of chess, then AI is the queen — with the ability to create powerful strategic advantages for whoever plays it best.” Tool sprawl is unavoidable. Security practitioners have their favorite tools. Employees come and go. Over time, large teams end up with dozens and dozens of tools, many with redundant or overlapping features. Research firm IDC notes thattool sprawl creates unanticipated security issues, making it harder to identify and mitigate risks, slowing incident response and increasing costs. CSOs agree— and that’s why they’re taking it all, looking instead toconsolidate their IT tools set. Addressing security tool sprawl means identifying gaps and overlaps and then consolidating via security tool rationalization. One way many companies consolidate security tools is by taking a platform approach. “There is a tried-and-true colloquialism that says that you cannot protect what you cannot see,” says Chris Kissel, vice president of security and trust at IDC, and one of the authors of IDC’s “The Implications of Security Tool Sprawl” report. “The problem is that if there are too many tools in an organization, analysts are in a place where they suffer from technical debt trying to learn new dashboards, syntax, and procedures. Tool sprawl is yielding to tools consolidation.” Reducing your security application portfolio in favor of a platform approach can offer additional business benefits, IDC argues, including cost savings, reductions in overall security architecture complexity that improve security operations efficiency, and a more easily sharable and scalable security policy. There are currently 470,000 estimated openings for cybersecurity professionals, according to cyberseek.org. On average, cybersecurity roles take 21% longer to fill than other IT jobs. And from May 2023 through April 2024, there were only 85 cybersecurity workers available for every 100 cybersecurity jobs. The implications of not having enough security talent is detailed in the World Economic Forum’sGlobal Cybersecurity Outook2024.This year, 36% of respondents said that skills gaps are the main challenge to achieving cyber-resilience goals. Some 78% of respondents reported that their organizations do not have the in-house skills to fully achieve their cybersecurity objectives. And 57% of respondents from an ISC2 cybersecurity workforce study believe that theshortage of cybersecurity staffis putting organizations in moderate to extreme risk of experiencing a cybersecurity attack. At the CISO level, nearly one-third (32%) say the cybersecurity skills shortage hashad a significant impact on their organization. To combat this, CISOs need to focus on employee retention, educate the C-suite and board on the importance of shrinking the gap, and rethink their strategies to incorporate more automation and, where necessary, service partners. James Globe, vice president of strategic advisor cybersecurity capabilities at the Center for Internet Security, says, “My prediction is that the gap between available skilled and experienced cybersecurity and information technology talent and unfilled cybersecurity positions will continue to increase, in particular for public sector organizations. M&A activity among cybersecurity vendors has been slow the past couple of years, but thefloodgates opened in 2024. Ciscocompleted its $28B acquisition of Splunk.Broadcom announced it would combine Symantec (which it purchased in 2019) with Carbon Black (which it acquired when it bought VMware) to create a new business unit called Enterprise Security Group. IBM announced plans to sell its QRadar SIEM to Palo Alto Networks. Identity security vendor CyberArk agreed to buy identity management leader Venafi. The list goes on. LogRhythm announced plans to merge with Exabeam, Zscaler bought Avalor, CrowdStrike bought Flow Security, Cohesity is buying the Veritas data protection business, SonicWall is snapping up Banyan Security, Akamai bought NoName Security. HPE’s purchase of networking industry veteran Juniper Networks is not security related, per se, but is part of the ongoing trend of large vendors making significant acquisitions to build broad platforms that have a security component. With all the M&A activity, CISOs are left to sort out the impact of newly consolidated tool sets, new overlords for solutions they depend on, and shifts to vendors’ wares and strategies in the wake of buyouts. That all begins withasking the right questions. The days of security existing in a silo are over. Security is increasingly being integrated across the tech stack and across the business. For example, the “shift left” trend integrates security within the software development process so that code is written, tested and deployed with security in mind throughout the process. A recent GitLabGlobal DevSecOpssurvey indicated that 56% of software development, security, and IT leaders use DevOps orDevSecOps, up 9% over the previous year. The top benefit driving adoption was heightened security. Security and networking are also merging in the form of single-vendor SASE, which combines networking and security tools (SD-WAN, network firewalling,Zero Trust Network Access,cloud access security broker (CASB), secure web gateway (SWG). According to Gartner, offerings that deliver converged network and security-as-a-service are increasingly popular. By 2027, 65% of new SD-WAN purchases will be part of a SASE offering, Gartner predicts. With so many high-profile security breaches seemingly occurring one after the other, security has moved well beyond the SOC. Security and business teams are working together tomake sure new apps are deployed securely. Security execs arealigning with regulatory, legal, insurance and risk management teams. And in many organizations, having someone with a security backgroundsitting on the board of directorshas become a necessity. Ransomware’s malevolent cousin, extortion, is on the rise. According to the Verizon Data Breach Report, extortion is now a component in 9% of all breaches. While ransomware attackslock up the victim’s dataand threaten to delete it or sell it on the dark web in exchange for a ransom, extortion attacks threaten to expose sensitive or embarrassing information. With genAI, that information, in the form or an image, video, or audio, doesn’t even have to be real; it can be computer generated. And extortion attempts don’t necessarily occur in isolation; they can becombined with ransomwareinto multi-faceted attacks that can includeDDoS attacks, encrypting and exfiltrating data, plus threating to expose sensitive corporate, personal data of corporate execs, as well as customer information. As with ransomware, the best defense against extortion attempts is strong data protection,strong anti-phishing policies and procedures, and the capability to detect and block attacks. IoT represents a way for businesses to instrument their physical assets with connected sensors that enable performance monitoring, troubleshooting, and preventive maintenance. But they also provide alightly defended target for cyberattacks. A Forrester survey that asked respondents to identify the top sources of external attacks found that IoT systems were the No. 1 target at 32%, followed by corporate-owned computers (28%) and employee-owned devices (26%). And breach costs were higher when IoT devices were targeted, because poorly defended IoT devices remained vulnerable for longer periods of time before the breach was discovered. It’s little wonder then that IoT and connected devices are among thebiggest contributors to expanding application attack surfaces. And it has gotten so bad that adversaries aredredging up old malware, like theMirai botnetfrom 2016, fine-tuning it, andlaunching fresh attacks against IoT, particularly in industries such as healthcare and manufacturing. In response, companies such as CyCognito, Cymulate, Forescout, Microsoft, and Lansweeper are offering tools to help organizations get a handle on how many IoT devices are out there, and providing vulnerability risk context. In addition, vendors such as Keyfactor, Thales Group, and Utimaco are offering identity and access management for IoT devices.

11 top bug bounty programs launched in 2024,https://www.csoonline.com/article/657751/top-bug-bounty-programs.html,"Software providers continue to rely on community support to help them identify code mistakes that can lead to malicious attacks. What are bug bounty programs? Bug bounty programs focus in 2024 Alphabet puts a higher bounty on bugs Microsoft revamps long-running vulnerability disclosure scheme UK military arms itself to repel security threats Critical Backpack vulnerabilities pay up to $100,000 AI start-up Anthropic launches bug reporting scheme French government agency offers up to €5,000 Netflix entertains bug bounty reports Airbnb checks out vulnerabilities Monzo banks on bug bounties Grafana seeks hacker help in rooting out source code flaws Bluefin bug bounty pays up to $5,000 Related content Australian financial firm hit with lawsuit after massive data breach Generative AI red teaming: Tips and techniques for putting LLMs to the test Security operations centers are fundamental to cybersecurity — here’s how to build one Chinese APT Silk Typhoon exploits IT supply chain weaknesses for initial access Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Bug bounty programs remain a crucial component of cybersecurity strategies in 2024, offering organisations the ability to draw in help from a diverse pool of cybersecurity professionals and researchers. Theschemesoffer continuous testing against emerging threats. Bug bounty programs are structured systems for individuals to identify and report security vulnerabilities and other bugs. They are offered by organisations, websites, and software developers. These programs are designed to leverage the skills of ethical hackers to enhance the security of software and systems before malicious parties can exploit these vulnerabilities. Participants, often referred to as bug bounty hunters, earn financial rewards or other forms of recognition for successfully reporting vulnerabilities in assets covered by bug bounty programs. Exploits achieved through social engineering trickery such as phishing are typically excluded. For ethical hackers, best practice for bug bounty hunting in 2024 involves thorough reconnaissance of a target organisation’s technology stack, rather than just running automated tools. Leading bug bounty platforms such as Bugcrowd, HackerOne, Synack, YesWeHack and Intigriti offer rewards for identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities. Platforms connect ethical hackers with organizations, providing a structured framework for vulnerability disclosure and resolution — managing bug bounty rewards on behalf of their corporate clients. Technology providers and government organizations run stand-alone bug bounty programs as part of a broader security testing strategy that also includes penetration tests. Here are the notable programs launched in 2024: Alphabetupped the rewards on offer through its bug bounty programto a maximum of $151,515 in July, recognising that as its systems become more mature it is getting harder to find bugs. The value of the payout will reflect the quality of reports, with exceptional quality reports earning a 50% bonus on baseline payment. Conversely poor quality but valid vulnerability disclosures will only earn half the reward they might otherwise have earned. For example, a logic flaw leading to a Gmail account takeover risk will earn $50,000 multiplied by a potential 1.5 quality multiplier to earn up to $75,000. The same bug would have earned only $13,337 before this year’s increase. Google Web Services, its Chrome browser and Android and Google Devices are all within scope of elements of Google’s Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP). Not to be outdone, Microsoft significantly increased its bug bounty payouts in the past year. Between 2020 and 2023, Microsoft paid out roughly $13 million annually through its bug bounty programs. However, in 2024, this amount increased to $16.6 million. The rewards went to 343 security researchers from a total of 55 countries. Cloud services including the Azure, Microsoft Identity, Edge, Windows and Office 365 are all covered by theprogram. “As the security landscape and Microsoft’s attack surface evolves, so does the Microsoft Bounty Program,” Microsoft said in ablog post reviewing its bug bounty program. “Whether expanding scope to cover new Microsoft products and services or aligning research targets to protect against malicious actors and novel attack vectors, the Microsoft Bounty Program responds with program enhancements continuously.” In April,Microsoft introduced a new bug bounty program specifically for AI, offering up to $15,000 for validated vulnerability reports involving its Copilot AI technology. In February, theUK’s Ministry of Defence(MOD) announced that it was expanding defensive security initiative with HackerOne. The original scope of the three-year-old program included vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty programs. The MOD has now broadened the scope of the vulnerability disclosure program (VDP) to include several of its key suppliers as part of a wider scheme to improve supply chain security and ultimately push them towards introducing their own vulnerability disclosure programs. Cloud software-as-a-service collaboration platform provider Kahootz is an initial adopter of MOD’s supplier VDP program. The UK scheme is inspired, at least in part, by the US’sHack the Pentagon program. Those looking for more financial lucrative rewards should look for flaws in Backpack, an exchange that focuses on non-custodial wallet and browser extension. Thebug bounty, also launched in July and hosted by Immunefi, offers rewards of up to $100,000 for confirmed vulnerabilities in Backpack’s web or API. Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic launched a vulnerability disclosure program (VDP), managed by HackerOne, in August with bounty rewards up to $15,000 for novel, universal jailbreak attacks that could expose vulnerabilities in critical, high-risk domains such as CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear) and cybersecurity. A jailbreak attack in AI involves a method for circumventing an AI system’s built-in safety measures and ethical guidelines, allowing a user to elicit responses or behaviours from the AI system that would normally get blocked. “As we work on developing the next generation of our AI safeguarding systems, we’re expanding our bug bounty program to introduce a new initiative focused on finding flaws in the mitigations we use to prevent misuse of our models,”Anthropic said in a blog post on the revamped program. VDPs offer a structured system that makes it easier for security researchers to report bug without offering financial rewards. Over time, many organisations have graduated from VDPs towards fully fledged rewards-offering bug bounty programs. Anthropic’s VDPcovers its public-facing website and other digital assets including the Claude iOS app, claude.ai domain, internal apps and services, APIs and software development kits. The Direction Interministérielle du NUMérique (DINUM), the agency in charge of the French State’s digital transformation, isoffering a bug bounty program through YesWeHack. DINUM’s web applications and APIs are the primary targets of the scheme, which launched in February. The program welcomes reports of classic web application security vulnerabilities including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and remote code execution. Attacks that expose valid credentials on an in-scope asset stand to earn rewards of up to €5,000. Reports of leaks of sensitive information are outside the scope of the program. Netflix’s bug bounty program is designed to enhance the security of its products and services by crowdsourcing security vulnerability reports from the hacker community. The program, which becamepublic in 2018, was originally hosted by Bugcrowd before moving to HackerOne. Thelatest version of the program, launched in May, offers security researchers rewards of up to $25,000 for the most critical vulnerabilities. Its primary targets include the Netflix.com user experience. High severity targets include methods of subverting content authorization or obtaining private keys. Netflix’s mobile apps for iOS and Android are also in scope. Airbnb launched a revamped bug bounty program through HackerOnein May. Payouts of up to $25,000 are on offer for ethical hackers who discover flaws in Airbnb’s website or mobile apps. A wide range of web application security vulnerabilities are eligible under the scheme from the online homestay marketplace. Airbnb has paid out a total of $2.4 million in bounties through the scheme since it first launched in 2015. The vulnerability disclosure program has resolved 1,394 reports to date. Average bounties range from $500-$750. In July, British digital bankMonzo launched a public bug bounty program through Intigriti. The program offers payments for validated critical vulnerability finds of up to €12,500. Technologies in scope include the bank’s website, APIs, internal tooling and mobile apps. Grafana, an open-source platform for monitoring and observability, has also launched a bug bounty program via Intigriti. Reported critical and validated vulnerabilities can receive up to €15,000 through the scheme, launched in May. The program is geared towards incentivising ethical hackers to uncover flaws in Grafana’s software. Grafana Labs developedpluginsnot installed by default are accepted, but not eligible for a bounty. Bluefin launched a bug bounty program with Immunefi, the bug bounty and security services platform for Web3, in July. The trade.bluefin.io website and associated assets are the primary focus of the program, which offers rewards of up to $5,000. A wide range of web security vulnerabilities are in scope – including SQL injection, cross-sire request forgery as well as bugs that result in the leakage of sensitive information. Business logic issues and payment manipulation problems are also eligible for potential rewards.

The cyber assault on healthcare: What the Change Healthcare breach reveals,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3484304/the-cyber-assault-on-healthcare-what-the-change-healthcare-breach-reveals.html,"February’s ransomware attack is a wake-up call for healthcare execs – and a reminder to leaders in other industries about what can go wrong. Damage from the Change Healthcare breach continues to mount The state of cybersecurity in healthcare Why do hackers go after healthcare? Attacks are rising as challenges abound Healthcare is taking steps to improve security Calls for more healthcare organizations to tighten security Related content Report on ransomware attacks on Fortinet firewalls also reveals possible defenses The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time Generative AI red teaming: Tips and techniques for putting LLMs to the test The state of ransomware: Fragmented but still potent despite takedowns Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  The February 2024 ransomware attack on Change Healthcare put the state of healthcare cybersecurity in the headlines and in front of the US Congress, with aftershocks from the seismic event still being felt. Themonumental impact of the attackwas evident nearly immediately. The ransomware group ALPHV (also known as BlackCat) hit Change Healthcare in February, stealing six terabytes of data — including sensitive personal information. The hackers used compromised credentials toremotely access a Change Healthcare Citrix portal, technology that allowed remote access to desktops, on or around Feb. 12. Company officials have acknowledged that the portal was not protected withmultifactor authentication, despite MFA beinga now-standard enterprise security control. Dealing with the incident will cost Change Healthcare’s parent company, UnitedHealth Group (UHG), more than $1 billion; that includes lost revenue, direct recovery costs and a $22-million Bitcoin payout to the hacker group. Others suffered, too. To stem the damage, Change Healthcare went offline, which in turn created a huge backlog of unpaid claims that left hospitals and doctors’ offices with serious cashflow problems and threatened patient access to care. Change Healthcare is one of the largest health payment processing companies in the world and serves as a clearinghouse for 15 billion medical claims each year — some 40% of all claims,according to US government records. The scope of damage and its cost has grown since the attack first happened. An American Medical Association survey found that 80% of clinicians lost revenue during the breach, 77% experienced service disruptions, 55% had to use personal funds to pay bills, and 44% were unable to buy supplies. One clinician shared with the survey that the incident “may bankrupt our practice of 50 years in this rural community.” Consequently, the attack — labeled “the most significant and consequential incident of its kindagainst the US healthcare system in history” by American Hospital Association President and CEO Rick Pollack — has prompted consumer anger and investigations as well as calls for more regulations and more rigorous evaluations of enterprise defense strategies. “If the need to be more prepared, to become more resilience, wasn’t clear before, it certainly has been brought into focus by recent events,” says Lee Kim, senior principal of cybersecurity and privacy with the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS), a nonprofit that promotes health information and technology. Kim and other cybersecurity leaders say the attack is a wake-up call to executives in all sectors, stressing the escalating consequences and costs of breaches as the world becomes ever more connected. Research provides a telling look into the state ofcybersecurity in the healthcare sector. The 2023 HIMSS Healthcare Cybersecurity study, for example, found that 55% of respondents reported that their organization experienced a significant security incident in the prior 12 months and 12% had suffered a ransomware attack. The“Study on Cyber Insecurity in Healthcare 2023”from Ponemon Institute, a nonprofit research organization, and security software maker Proofpoint found that 88% of organizations experienced an average of 40 attacks in the prior 12 months, with the average total cost of a cyberattack being almost $5 million. It also found that 64% of organizations had suffered a supply chain attack in the prior two years, 63% had an average of 21 cloud compromises during the prior two years, and 54% experienced an average of four ransomware attacks during the prior two years. All organizations surveyed had at least one incident in which sensitive healthcare data was lost or stolen. Yet despite such findings and the magnitude of the Change Healthcare breach, security officials do not consider the healthcare industry a cybersecurity laggard, with multiple sources saying that the sector has made significant improvements in its security posture over the past decade. Findings from Statista, a German market and consumer data company, back up such assertions. It studied the distribution of cyberattacks across worldwide industries in 2023 and found that healthcare is in the middle, suffering 6.3% — compared to manufacturing at the top of the list with 25.7%. However, security leaders say those numbers could shift, as healthcare institutions become a more popular target for hackers for multiple reasons. To start, healthcare entities typically hold what hackers see as a treasure trove of data – including Social Security numbers and financial information, says David Brumley, a Carnegie Mellon University professor whose research focuses on software security and CEO of security software company ForAllSecure. They also often have complex technology environments with both IT systems and operational technology (OT) as well as plenty of legacy tech. All of this creates an expansive attack surface and the potential for more ways in, says John Riggi, the American Hospital Association’s national adviser for cybersecurity and risk. At the same time. healthcare entities vary in the resources they can invest in security, with small and rural organizations often lacking the money and staff needed to significantly beef up defenses, Riggi and others say. Yet the healthcare sector is highly interconnected, as the Change Healthcare attack showed, with entities of all types — regardless of security maturity — sharing data, which Brumley says makes third-party attacks both more probable and more potent in healthcare than in other, less interconnected industries. Moreover, the sector — like most others today — is highly reliant onsoftware vendorsto create, deliver and maintain secure products, even though healthcare IT and security leaders usually lack the ability to determine whether those products are truly secure by design, Brumley adds. And because of the real life-and-death need to access systems and data, Brumley says healthcare entities have shown that they’re willing to quickly pay hackers during ransomware attacks — a fact that makes them a target for future attacks. Indeed, attacks increased quarter over quarter in 2023, according to the2023 Q4 Cybersecurity Trends and Threats in the Healthcare Sector report from Health-ISAC. The report showed that ransomware attacks against healthcare increased from just under 60 in Q1 to more than 140 in Q4. Meanwhile, security leaders within the healthcare sector have faced — and continue to contend with — significant and sometimes sector-specific challenges to solving for those factors that make them a target and that can up the chances of a successful attack. Many security leaders report that they don’t have adequate resources to implement the needed security measures because they’re often competing with pricey life-saving medical equipment for the limited funds available to spend, Kim says. Furthermore, he says their complex technology environments can make applying and creating security in depth not only more challenging but more costly, too. That, in turn, makes it less likely for CISOs to get the resources they need. Security teams in healthcare also have more challenges in updating and patching systems, Riggi explains, as the sector’s need for 24/7 availability means organizations can’t easily go offline — if they can go offline at all — to perform needed work. Healthcare security leaders also have a rapidly expanding tech environment to secure, as both more partners and more patients with remote medical devices become part of the sector’s already highly interconnected environment, says Errol S. Weiss, chief security officer at Health-ISAC. Such expansion heightens the challenges, complexities and costs of implementing security controls as well as heightening the risks that a successful attack against one point in that web would impact many others. “The amount of complexity, the interconnectedness, the number of external partners and providers that are part of this giant ecosystem all make the task of securing healthcare systems so difficult and so enormous,” Weiss says. As is the case in other industries, the healthcare sector is working to improve its security posture. For example, 55% of respondents to the HIMSS survey reported that their 2023 security budgets were higher than the previous year’s budget. (That’s up from the 52% who saw a year-over-year increase in the 2022 survey.) Looking ahead, 58% of respondents said they expected their budgets for 2024 to be higher than their 2023 budgets. The HIMSS survey also found that security is now a board-level concern, with 62% saying their boards oversee cybersecurity risk and 68% saying their directors get regular briefings on cybersecurity risk. “Today healthcare CEOs are talking about attack surface and risk. That’s a conversation that five or 10 years ago that would never have happened,” says Nitin Natarajan, a deputy director at the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Natarajan and others highlight additional steps the healthcare sector is taking to boost security, citing as examples the US Food and Drug Administration’s 2023 guidelines for secure-by-design medical devices and the increasing level of information-sharing that happens via various channels such as the Health-ISAC. In fact, Health-ISAC’s Threat Operations Center (TOC)published 1,044 targeted alerts in 2023to member and nonmember organizations — a 281% increase over the number of alerts sent in 2022. “The industry is investing more in security; they’re stepping into the problem. We could argue they should have been doing it sooner, but they are making progress,” says Robert Booker, chief strategy officer at HITRUT, an organization that delivers data protection standards and certification programs,and chair of the Healthcare Third-Party Risk Management Alliance. The Change Healthcare attack is pushing the industry to make even more improvements, security officials say. Booker, a former CISO at UnitedHealth Group, says the attack also serves as a blaring reminder to healthcare organizations to “make sure you focus on the basics and essential security measures, like multifactor authentication, have them where you need them, which is everywhere, and have a way to know that what you’re doing is right, have an assurance capabilities that shows your stuff is working.” Authors of the HIMSS report also called for more to be done, for instance, writing that “while almost two-thirds of respondents indicated that their board of directors are regularly briefed regarding cybersecurity risk, this number needs to be higher. Ideally, more healthcare organizations will embark upon the proactive journey of regularly briefing their boards of directors.” The authors additionally called out the need for more supply chain risk management: “Less than half of respondents (41.92%) to this survey indicated that their organization has established a cybersecurity supply chain risk management program. The remainder of respondents (58.08%) indicated that they either did not have such a program or were unsure. The risk of not having a robust cybersecurity supply chain management program is that there may be too much dependency on one vendor or supplier.” And HIMSS officials advocated for healthcare entities to adopt the NIST Cybersecurity Framework Version 2.0 and the recently released US Department of Health and Human Services’ voluntary cybersecurity performance goals (CPGs). Others agree that such moves need to happen — and happen fast. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat representing Oregon and one of many US lawmakers calling for more scrutiny of UHG in the aftermath of the attack, has criticized the slow pace of action. He has faulted the Biden administration’s timeline for putting healthcare cybersecurity regulations — saying the yearend goal is too far out. “Every new devastating hack hammers home the need for mandatory cybersecurity standards in the healthcare sector, particularly when it comes to the largest companies that millions of patients depend on for care and medicine,” Wyden says in a statement to CSO. “Without action, patients’ access to care and their personal health information will be compromised and ransomed by hackers over and over again.” Weiss says healthcare security leaders and other sector executives got that message and they are working to learn lessons from the Change Healthcare incident and to implement additional security measures to improve their own security posture and their own resilience. Benjamin Luthy, program director of cybersecurity and an adjunct professor at Champlain College Online, says it’s a worthwhile exercise: “Everyone can learn a lesson; anyone who leads a security or information technology program can learn from this.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS Report on ransomware attacks on Fortinet firewalls also reveals possible defenses

How to evaluate and mitigate risks to the global supply chain,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3819136/how-to-evaluate-and-mitigate-risks-to-the-global-supply-chain.html,"CISOs are under the gun to understand and address potential risks tied to geopolitical tensions, regulations and other changes outside their control. Understand your risks and exposure Maintain a diversified supply chain Implement robust risk assessment and monitoring Maintain ongoing visibility over your supplier’s compliance obligations Related content Trump shifts cyberattack readiness to state and local governments in wake of info-sharing cuts SpyCloud’s 2025 Identity Exposure Report Reveals the Scale and Hidden Risks of Digital Identity Threats Attack time frames are shrinking rapidly. Here’s how cyber teams can cope The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Enterprise security leaders face mounting pressure to protect their global IT supply chains against threat actors and an increasingly complex regulatory and geopolitical landscape. Recent events — from trade disputes to regional conflicts — have shown how quickly geopolitical tensions can disrupt access to critical technologies and expose organizations to breaches via attacks on trusted suppliers and third-party services. In some cases, the disruptions and changes were caused by government action and in others by cyberattacks tied to military and geopolitical conflicts around the world. Examples of the former include the US government’s ban on telecommunications equipment fromHuaweiand ZTE and its near total ban on the use ofKaspersky’s softwarein 2024 overnational security concerns. US organizations, especially within the federal government, suddenly restricted from using technologies from these companies had to rip and replace them in a hurry. Other instances, like theattack on SolarWinds, showed how Russia-US tensions manifested in software supply chain attacks. Increasingly, security leaders are required to look beyond traditional cyber defenses and develop strategies that account for rapid shifts at a global level as well, says Trey Ford, CISO at Bugcrowd. “Our businesses operate, technologies are sourced, customers engage, and employees serve from all around the globe today,” he says. “The tapestry that creates our business ecosystem is very interconnected, and the dependencies are intricate.” The new reality means security leaders need to understand everything from weather impacting regions, to socio-political shifts, to announcements in legislation or legal decisions that impact their businesses, customers, and suppliers, Ford noted. “Diversity of perspective is the CISO’s best friend. We require discussion and insight from operations, legal, privacy, and compliance to first enumerate, and only then, understand the ways regional events impact the business.” To help cybersecurity leaders, here are four tips to mitigate some of these risks: Everything in cyber starts with an inventory, and it’s no different when it comes to understanding global supply chain risks. Knowing where your people operate from, where services are delivered from and to, where technology is hosted or sourced from, and knowing all the regions that your organization has business relationships with, is fundamental to supply chain security, according to Ford. Also vital is the need to understand and map data flows across international boundaries, understanding changing data protection regulations in key markets, maintaining flexibility in data storage and processing locations and planning for potential restrictions on cross-border data transfers. “A strong relationship with in-house legal, outside counsel, and either trade organizations or a legislative affairs partner will keep you apprised of change in key markets,” Ford says. “Asking legal to brief on trends would be a great way to keep these things top of mind for the security teams, and those supporting risk management at the company.” It’s also a good idea to partner with security vendors invested in public policy and global services. It’s a good way of staying current and supporting advocacy influence on cyber-specific matters of import. Organizations that source from international technology suppliers need to ensure they are not overly reliant on a single vendor, single region or even a single technology. Maintaining a diversified supply chain can mitigate costly disruptions from a cyberattack or vulnerability involving a key supplier, or from disruptions tied to regulatory shifts, trade restrictions or geopolitical conflicts. “What we’re talking about here is business resiliency or, more narrowly, supply chain risk management,” says Bruce Jenkins, CISO at Black Duck.“One must identify the likelihood and impact of supplier disruption and identify the alternatives.” Security leaders should make sure to include these risks and potential impacts in their overall enterprise business impact analysis (BIA) process—and the alternative plans for addressing them, in their business continuity plan (BCP), Jenkins recommends. Strategically sourcing from multiple suppliers and regions where possible can enable better resilience and adaptability to emerging threats or unexpected geopolitical shifts. “If you’ve got key technology partnerships with access or delivery sourced in geographies of concern it is worth cultivating alternatives that are warm,” recommends Ford at Bugcrowd. “If you’ve got regions all served or accessed through common undersea cable connections understand what disruption could look like, and how you’d address an outage or degradation of service.” Implement a risk assessment and monitoring program for your global IT supply chain, or review—and update where necessary—any such program you might have in place already. Organizations with suppliers in geopolitically volatile areas should consider developing an early warning capability that combines external threat intelligence feeds, news monitoring and regional business analysis. The goal should be to anticipate potential disruptions before they impact operations. “CISOs must adopt a proactive, risk-based approach when managing suppliers, especially in regions with complex regulatory or geopolitical dynamics,” says Darren Guccione, CEO and co-founder at Keeper Security. “Understanding the risks posed by suppliers in high-risk areas is critical.” Continuous tracking and monitoring of global and regional tensions is especially crucial in regions where key suppliers operate or where critical technologies are sourced. The goal should be to understand how evolving trade policies and sanctions might affect access to security tools, updates, and services — especially when these policies target technology sectors or specific companies. One example is the US government’s 2024 ban on the use of Kaspersky’s security products in the US. “If there is a sanction event that results in your inability to leverage your supplier’s solutions, I recommend attempting to maintain open and honest communications with your supplier,” Jenkins from Black Duck says. “Your contracting and export compliance legal teams should be leveraged for this,” he notes. If sanctions or regulatory actions directly or indirectly impact your ability to maintain communications and fulfill due diligences obligations it’s best to follow the mitigation route in your BCP, he advises. IT suppliers, even reputable and large ones, can sometimes fall afoul of international and export control regulations. In 2023, for instance, Microsoft had topay a fine of $3.3 millionto the US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for allegedly selling its software to a Russian company on a US sanction list. In another incident, virtual currency exchange Kraken had to pay afine of over $360,000to settle US charges that the company had violated sanctions against Iran. Sometimes, non-compliance by a supplier can lead to restrictions that may impact your organization’s ability to operate globally, so it’s vital to continually monitor your supply chain to ensure ethical sourcing. Be consistent, methodical and regular with your third-party risk management (TPRM) practices. Ensure that your suppliers meet recognized security certifications such as SOC 2 Type 2 and ISO 27001, Guccione says. “Clear contractual agreements outlining cybersecurity standards and data handling protocols are essential to ensure that suppliers meet the organization’s security requirements,” he notes. Establish a strong governance framework that includes regular audits, compliance checks and continuous monitoring. At the same time, be aware of the limits of your efforts within the context of a specific geopolitical or regulatory environment, Jenkins cautions. “Understand and work within those constraints, whatever they are, and don’t waste your time pushing back unless there is indisputable business value in doing so.”. Document your efforts for audit purposes and use the outcomes of your efforts for future risk-based decision-making around procurement and business resiliency programs, Jenkins noted.

Mastering the tabletop: 3 cyberattack scenarios to prime your response,https://www.csoonline.com/article/2144047/mastering-the-tabletop-exercise-3-cyberattack-scenarios-and-how-to-plan-a-robust-response.html,"Tabletop exercises are a great way to get your security team in shape for a cyber incident.

How CISOs can talk effectively about a cyber incident’s toll Report on ransomware attacks on Fortinet firewalls also reveals possible defenses Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Security leaders live by the axiom that it is not a matter ofifbutwhenthey will fall victim to a cybersecurity incident. Because of this, CISOs often strive to get ahead of the inevitable by implementing incident response and business continuity plans. But without runningtabletops— dry-run exercises oriented aroundspecific security incidents and scenarios— you can never know how your plans or team might stand up against a real-world incident. For those who have never run a tabletop or are pressed for time to craft a specific scenario, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) provides detailedTabletop Exercise Packages (CTEP)that can give security leaders a head start. Here are three of CISA’s CTEPs that create incredible value due to their breadth and depth and flexible templatized packages for any organization to use. Softwaresupply chain attackscontinue to rise, with malicious actors increasingly targeting open-source software (OSS) packages due to their high return on investment. Rather than targeting a single organization or product, attackers have realized they can compromise a widely used OSS package and have a massive downstream impact. The problem is exacerbated by a lack of visibility into the full inventory of OSS components an organization consumes, either directly for internal development purposes or via products from vendors in their supply chain. Organizations such as Synopsys have pointed out that 70% to 90% of modern codebases contain OSS components and that OSS components make up 70% or more of the overall codebase. These components, while offering key benefits such as cost savings, speed and efficiency, also come with risks such as a lack of resources for maintenance, with 25% of OSS projects having a single maintainer and 94% having fewer than 10. This is why organizations such as Sonatype have found245,000 malicious packages in the past year, twice those found in all previous years combined that its report has been tracking. FromLog4jto the latestXZ Utilsscare, the OSS ecosystem has key risks that organizations need to account for, which is exactly why CISA released the OSS CTEP. CISA’sOSS CTEPis structured over 180 minutes and includes various activities capped off by a hotwash. It orients around the NIST CSF in phases of govern, identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. Some of the key objectives include: Discuss organizational resilience and response to threats targeting open-source projects. Familiarize stakeholders with reporting processes and respective roles and responsibilities during a cyber incident stemming from a critical OSS project. Identify areas for improvement in incident reporting processes, policies and procedures Examine response coordination efforts between public, private and community stakeholders during a cyber incident The CTEP lays out a couple of scenarios involving the introduction of a vulnerability into an OSS community’s toolchain leading to a worldwide system of compromises and delays associated with patching the vulnerability. While much of the CTEP is aimed at being an actionable exercise for the OSS community and maintainers themselves, it can serve as a useful framework for organizations as well. Key questions could include: Do we understand what OSS components we’re consuming and using, what systems they reside on, and which vendors are integrating them into the products that we use? In the event of an OSS package compromise, how would we go about following the incident management lifecycle as identified by NIST to respond to and recover from the incident? What actions can we take to mitigate risk to the organization involving the impacted systems and products? How can we make more risk-informed decisions around the OSS projects and components we consume and use? How do we respond to our vendors in our supply chain to ensure we have transparency around the components in their products which may pass down risk to us? The outcomes of these thought-provoking questions and activities can be codified into organizational policies and processes to bolster the organization’s resiliency against OSS software supply chain attacks moving forward. Ransomwarehas easily become one of the most notorious and pervasive attack vectors wreaking havoc on the digital ecosystem. Someestimateshave ransomware hackers in 2023 bringing in double the 2022 total of $567 million in cryptocurrency payments from cyberattacks. Ransomware attackers seek to gain access to data or systems until some form of compensation or demand is met. Notable incidents include the2021 attack on Colonial Pipelinewhich not only had financial consequences but societal impact, bringing broader awareness to citizens that cyberattacks can affect daily life. Other notable events includeWannacry,NotPetya,Lockyandmany others, as the list continues to grow. We’ve even now seen ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) subscription-based models evolve in which ransomware groups sell their code or access to attackers and interested parties. They may sell or lease variants of their ransomware to buyers, which is compelling givenestimatesput the average ransomware demand in 2021 for example at $6 million. CISA’sCTEP Situation Manual for Ransomwarecan be used for tabletop exercises to bolster resiliency against ransomware attacks. Much like the OSS CTEP, it is 180 minutes long, involves a diverse set of stakeholders across the organization, and various activities oriented around the NIST CSF. Key objectives include: Examining an organization’s response capabilities during a significant ransomware incident. Examining the ability to coordinate information sharing. Identify areas for improvement in cyber incident response plans and organizational resilience. Exploring and bolstering an organization’s plans to recover from the incident, and restore services, mission-critical assets, or systems. One scenario involves an employee of the organization being targeted by a phishing email as the entry point to a network/system and attackers compromising PII data and installing ransomware — a common scenario. Another scenario includes a CISA alert for a new ransomware variant, followed by dealing with end-of-life operating systems, a stolen laptop belonging to an employee, and employees contacting the VP of finance about a suspicious email with a PDF attachment. If these scenarios sound all too familiar, it is because they are. Dealing with these sorts of situations can be frustrating and challenging in enterprise environments, as organizations scramble to try and make sense of what is happening, how they may be impacted and how they respond to the threat and recover from it once they determine the actual impact. The ransomware CTEP explores aspects of an organization’s operational resiliency and poses key questions aimed at understanding threats to an organization, what information the attacker leverages, and how to conduct risk assessments to identify specific threats and vulnerabilities to critical assets. Given that ransomware attacks focus on data and systems, the scenario asks key questions about the accuracy of inventories and whether there are resources in place dedicated to mitigating known exploited vulnerabilities on internet-facing systems. This includes activities such as not just having backups, but their retention period and an understanding of how long it would take to restore from backups if necessary, in events such as a ransomware attack. Questions asked during the tabletop also include a focus on assessing zero-trust architecture implementation or lack thereof. This is critical, given that zero trust emphasizes least-permissive access control and network segmentation, practices that can limit the lateral movement of an attack and potentially keep it from accessing sensitive data, files, and systems. The exercise also involves assessing cybersecurity awareness training for employees. This is foundational when mitigating ransomware risks, because the initial attack vectors target employees viaphishingand other social engineering tactics. A robust cybersecurity awareness training program combined with procedures for employees to report suspected phishing attempts can help raise awareness among the security team and broader organization when malicious activity is potentially underway. The scenario progresses to involve traffic outside standard business hours, systems throughout the organization receiving ransom messages and blank screens, and security researchers discovering hacking groups on thedark webposting about compromising your organization. It’s posited that the hackers have accessed sensitive PII such as SSN’s, banking information, and more and shared a subset of the records to prove their success. This leads to internal tabletop questions oriented around resiliency planning, such as sustaining continuity of operations for essential functions and having incident response plans and being able to prioritize and perform IT restoration. It also involves being able to distinguish between normal and abnormal network traffic and having a codified cybersecurity incident response plan (IRP) that employees are trained on and have practiced (as with the tabletop). There is also a legal aspect for the organization depending on the nature of the data compromised, which is why questions in the scenario involve understanding security breach notification laws for a given country, state, and industry. This is an evolving area of cybersecurity, with efforts likeCIRCIAfor critical infrastructure and SEC changes for publicly traded companies that have a “material” cybersecurity incident. Organizations need to be well-versed in their disclosure requirements and have thought out communication plans to ensure both compliance and properly delivered messaging to the public and regulatory authorities as well as media outlets. There is also a need to understand what external partners need to be engaged from a legal and law enforcement perspective, all critical points organizations need to be aware ofpriorto a ransomware incident. The CISACTEP for Insider Threatsinvolves a hypothetical scenario in which a disgruntled former employee has taken advantage of the access they have through a third-party vendor with which the organization collaborates to exploit system vulnerabilities. This is a very plausible scenario given inherent third-party risks and the struggle to manage the ever-growing length of the supply chain and constant integrations between systems and environments via network connections, APIs, and more. The initial scenario involves an alert from CISA regarding a vulnerability in a specific microprocessor found throughout an organization that can allow attackers to access sensitive data. Replacing hardware can be expensive and time-consuming, so the threat can’t be entirely mitigated immediately. Meanwhile, an employee is terminated for treating co-workers poorly. During their exit, the former employee threatens the organization that it will regret the decision. This scenario generates questions to test how an organization actually receives these sorts of alerts from industry resources such as CISA and how they can potentially take action if they are relevant and potential threats. Also, given the employee’s history of bad behavior and threatening posture, there are questions about how contentious terminations should be handled and whether the organization has a procedure to retrieve the employee’s company equipment and remove access during the termination process. It also encourages the organization to consider what steps it can take to ensure former employees can no longer access organizational systems and data. In the scenario, employees report missing and altered files and deleted backups. Security gets involved, identifying administrator-level access occurring and systems and files being tampered with. The account is deactivated, and the extent of the damage is not initially known. Questions to think through during the tabletop include: How long does the organization keep backups? How long does it take to restore from backups and has that process actually been tested? The tabletop also invites discussions around how the organization is prepared to respond to the discovery of unauthorized administrative activity, who would be notified, and how. The point of the exercise is to force security teams to consider what resources are required for incident response and what processes might be invoked to mitigate the impact from malicious activity from an insider threat. There also may be a need to contact law enforcement and to sufficiently document the incident to be able to legally pursue the attacker and hold them accountable for the malicious activities. Scenarios like thesecan and often do play out, with former employees becoming frustrated with a former employer and looking to use insider information they are privy to, to try and compromise or negatively impact the organization both technically, financially and reputationally. Organizations need to have comprehensive plans and processes in place to halt malicious activities, mitigate the impact, respond to and recover from the incident and legally pursue the insider to hold them accountable for their actions.

Deepfakes: Coming soon to a company near you,https://www.csoonline.com/article/2140614/deepfakes-coming-soon-to-a-company-near-you.html,"AI-powered deepfake technology is rapidly advancing, and it’s only a matter of time before cybercriminals find a business model they can use, some security experts say. Deepfakes as credit risks You’re not my admin assistant No easy fixes Related content New phishing campaign uses scareware to steal Apple credentials GitHub accounts targeted with fake security alerts US charges 12 Chinese hackers in major government-backed espionage campaign Polyglot files used to spread new backdoor Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Deepfakes, the bane of celebrities and the fear of politicians, are poised to take off in the corporate world, as cybercriminals see them as a new way to make easy money, some security experts say. CIOs, CISOs, and other corporate leaders need to be ready for AI-assisted attacks that use realistic, but faked, voice calls, video clips, and live videoconferencing calls, says Michael Hasse, a longtime cybersecurity and IT consultant. Deepfakes involving voice calls are nothing new. Hasse recalls giving a presentation on the topic to asset management firms back in 2015, after some companies in the industry had fallen victim to voice-based scams. Since 2015, however, the AI-based technologies used for deepfakes have not only gotten better by magnitudes, but they also have become widely available, he notes. The main factor holding back widespread use of deepfakes by cybercriminals is the absence of a packaged, easy-to-use tool to create faked audio and video, Hasse says. But such a deepfakes package is coming soon, Hasse predicts, with it likely to start circulating in the criminal underground before the US elections in November, with political campaigns as the first targets. “Every single piece that’s needed is there,” Hasse says. “The only thing that has kept us from seeing it just flooding everything is that it takes time for the for the bad guys to incorporate stuff like this.” It’s not just cybersecurity experts who are warning of the corporate risk from deepfakes. In May, credit ratings firm Moody’sissued a warningabout deepfakes, saying they create new credit risks. The Moody’s report details a handful of attempted deepfake scams, including faked video calls, that have targeted the financial sector in the past two years. “Financial losses attributed to deepfake frauds are rapidly emerging as a prominent threat from this advancing technology,” the report says. “Deepfakes can be used to create fraudulent videos of bank officials, company executives, or government functionaries to direct financial transactions or carry out payment frauds.” Deepfake scams are already happening, but the size of the problem is difficult to estimate, says Jake Williams, a faculty member at IANS Research, a cybersecurity research and advisory firm. In some cases, the scams go unreported to save the victim’s reputation, and in other cases, victims of other types of scams may blame deepfakes as a convenient cover for their actions, he says. At the same time, any technological defenses against deepfakes will be cumbersome — imagine a deepfakes detection tool listening in on every phone call made by employees — and they may have a limited shelf life, with AI technologies rapidly advancing. “It’s hard to measure because we don’t have effective detection tools, nor will we,” says Williams, a former hacker at the US National Security Agency. “It’s going to be difficult for us to keep track of over time.” While some hackers may not yet have access to high-quality deepfake technology, faking voices or images on low-bandwidth video calls has become trivial, Williams adds. Unless your Zoom meeting is of HD or better quality, a face swap may be good enough to fool most people. Kevin Surace, chairman of multifactor authentication vendor Token, can provide firsthand testimony to the potential of voice-based deepfakes. He recently received an email from the administrative assistant of one of Token’s investors, but he immediately identified the email as an obvious phishing scam. Surace called the administrative assistant to warn her that phishing emails were being sent from her account, and the voice on the other end of the call sounded exactly like the employee, he says. When the voice on the other end of the call started responding oddly during the conversation, he asked about her coworkers, and the voice didn’t recognize their names. It turns out that the phone number included in the phishing email was one digit off from the administrative assistant’s real number. The fake phone number stopped working a couple of hours after Surace detected the problem. Criminals who want to fake a voice now need only a few seconds of a recording, and technology to create realistic live video deepfakes is getting better and better, says Surace, known as the father of the virtual assistant for his work onPortico at General Magicin the 1990s. “People are going to say, ‘Oh, this can’t be happening,’” he says. “It has now happened to a few people, and if it happened to three people, it’s going to be 300, it’s going to be 3,000, and so on.” So far, deepfakes targeting the corporate world have focused on tricking employees into transferring money to the criminals. But Surace can see deepfakes used for blackmail schemes or stock manipulation as well. If the blackmail amount is low enough, CEOs or other targeted people may decide to pay the fee instead of trying to explain that the person on the compromising video isn’t really them. Like Hasse, Surace sees a deepfakes wave coming soon. He expects that there’s a lot of scam attempts, like the one targeting him, already being attempted. “People don’t want to tell anyone it’s happening,” he says. “You pay 10 grand, and you just write it off and say, ‘It’s the last thing I want to tell the press about.’” Widespread use of deepfakes may be close, but there are a few impediments remaining, beyond the lack of an easy-to-use deepfakes package, Hasse says. Convincing deepfakes can require a level of computing power that some cybercriminals do not have. In addition, deepfake scams tend to work as targeted attacks, such aswhale phishing, and it takes some time to research the quarry. Potential victims, however, are helping cybercriminals by providing a wealth of information about their lives on social media. “The bad guys really don’t have a super-streamlined way to collect victim data and generate the deepfakes in a sufficiently automated fashion yet, but it’s coming,” Hasse says. With more deepfake scams likely coming to the corporate world, the question is how to deal with this growing threat. With deepfake technology continuously getting better, easy answers don’t exist. Hasse believes awareness and employee training will be important. Employees and executives need to be aware of potential deepfake scams, he says, and when a company insider asks them to do something suspicious, even if it’s on a video call, check back with them to verify the request. Making another phone call or verifying the request with a face-to-face conversation is an old-school form of multi-factor authentication, but it works, he says. When the asset management industry first began to fall victim to voice scams nearly a decade ago, advisors started to take their know-your-customer approaches to new heights. Conversations with clients began to start with conversations about their families, their hobbies, and other personal information to help verify their identities. Another defense for company executives and other critical employees may be to intentionally lie on social media to throw off deepfake attacks. “My guess is at some point there will be certain roles within companies where that is actually required,” he says. “If you’re in a sufficiently sensitive role in a sufficiently large corporation, there may be some kind of a level of scrutiny on the social media where a social media czar watches all the accounts.” CIOs, CISOs, and other company executives need to be aware of the threat and realize they could be targeted, Surace adds. His company sells a wearable multi-factor authentication device based on fingerprints, and he believes next-generation MFA products can help defend against deepfake scams. Next-gen MFA needs to be able to quickly and securely verify identities, such as every time employees log in to a Zoom meeting, he says. IANS’ Williams isn’t sure new technologies or employee training will be effective fixes. Some people will resist using a new authentication device, and cybersecurity training has been around for a long time, with limited success, he notes. Instead, companies need to put processes in place, such as using a secure application when employees transfer large sums of money. Using email or a voice call to ask for a huge money transfer isn’t secure, but some organizations still do it. For centuries, people have used voices and images to authenticate each other, but that time is ending, he says. “The reality is that using somebody’s voice or image likeness to authenticate that person has always been, if you look at it through a security perspective, inadequate,” Williams adds. “Technology is catching up with our substandard or ineffective processes.” PODCASTS VIDEOS

Disaster recovery vs ransomware recovery: Why CISOs need to plan for both,https://www.csoonline.com/article/2139710/disaster-recovery-vs-ransomware-recovery-why-cisos-need-to-plan-for-both.html,"Disruptive events can affect an organization in multiple ways, but with the right strategy and practice CISOs can minimize downtime and accelerate the recovery process. The difference between disaster and ransomware recoveries Resilience should go beyond checking boxes Priorities during an incident Have an asset inventory and a disaster leader Related content Critical remote code execution flaw patched in Veeam backup servers Signal threatens to leave France if encryption backdoor required Report on ransomware attacks on Fortinet firewalls also reveals possible defenses The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  On the morning of August 30, 2023, a fire broke out at a data center operated by Belgian telecom giant Proximus. Soon, emergency numbers 112, 101, and 100, which are used to call the ambulance, the firefighters, and the police, became unreachable. The situation lasted for almost half an hour before these essential services were restored. Every minute an organization is offline can be expensive and can even cost human lives. And whileransomwareattacks get most of the headlines, natural disasters can be devastating too. Fires, electrical failures, earthquakes, hurricanes, and even missile strikes in war-torn places like Ukraine can knock down data centers. Often, there’s no way of predicting when such events will occur, yet some risks can be mitigated if the right plans are in place. Preparing fornatural disasters, however, is different compared to dealing with ransomware attacks, because the type of damage and the priorities are different. Disaster recoverytypically focuses on physical infrastructure such as hard drives and network equipment, whereas ransomware recovery deals with data integrity and protection against cyber threats. “In a disaster, it’s quite possible that you need to replace hardware. In a cyber incident, it’s likely that you can recover the hardware, you just need to reset the device,” says Amar Ramakrishnan, vice president of product management at BackBox. Since natural disasters can affect data centers in multiple ways, organizations must develop several plans and clearly establish their priorities. “Understanding and documenting which of the scenarios you’ll be equipped for and which will be out of scope is an important part of the disaster recovery planning process,” Ramakrishnan tells CSO. Both natural disasters and ransomware attacks can create massive problems for companies. “While each type of attack differs, all can result in catastrophic losses that can cause businesses to shut down for a significant amount of time or cease operations completely,” says Steve Butterfield, VP of sales for EMEA at Arcserve. Many organizations approach disaster recovery and cyber incident response measures from a compliance perspective. They want to check all the required boxes, which means that sometimes, “they do the bare minimum,” says Igor Volovich, vice president of compliance strategy at Qmulos. While doing this is necessary, it is not sufficient. The better approach, he suggests, would be to treat compliance requirements as a detailed guide and adopt a more holistic view based on data that is automatically collected, analyzed, and reported in real time. This involves, of course, strengthening the security posture, as well as developing or updating a thorough disaster recovery plan. “Your plan should include your data backup strategy — including your recovery point objectives (RPOs) and recovery time objective (RTOs) — and detailed procedures for data restoration, system recovery, and business continuity,” Butterfield says. An effective backup solution is a must, says Butterfield, who recommends following the 3-2-1-1 strategy: Keep three copies of your data (one primary and two backups), with copies stored locally in two formats, and one copy stored offsite in the cloud or secure storage. The last one stands for immutable storage, where your backups are saved in a write-once-read-many-times format that can’t be altered or deleted. “Immutability differs from encryption in that there is no key, so there should be no way to read or reverse the immutability,” he says. “That gives you a last line of defense against any disaster.” Butterfield advocates for cloud storage, which offers “unmatched scalability and flexibility.” Some cloud solutions offer rapid recovery with automated backups and replication to multiple data centers so that, even if a local disaster strikes, the data remains accessible. But, in addition to cloud, organizations can consider tape backup, which can be reliable and affordable. “Tape is an excellent option for long-term data archiving and is especially effective for offsite, air-gapped storage — whether you use a virtual or physical air gap,” Butterfield says. “Tape is also very cost-effective for large volumes of data.” When it comes to creating the resilience strategy, Ramakrishnan recommends having separate plans for different potential crises and storing them in physical folders in the network operations center, in addition to electronic copies. “While electronic access is crucial, physical documentation provides a tangible backup and is easily accessible in situations where digital systems may be compromised,” he says. Downtime can also be reduced if engineers are well prepared to manage incidents, whether they are natural disasters or ransomware attacks. “Make sure that the network team is involved in company disaster recovery conversations,” Ramakrishnan says. In less mature organizations, these conversations sometimes happen without a network team member present. The response strategy for disasters and ransomware attacks focuses on bringing systems back online and minimizing downtime. In a natural and other type of disasters impacting IT systems, hardware and connectivity may be lost, which makes the process of recovery more challenging. In such situations, “it’s common for an affected organization’s production site to be partially or completely disabled,” says Sergei Serdyuk, vice president of product management at NAKIVO. When a disaster strikes, organizations should focus on restoring physical infrastructure, relocating operations, ensuring team safety, and re-establishing operational continuity. They should utilize logistics management and communication tools to coordinate response efforts. “Standard procedure invokes a failover to a dedicated disaster recovery site, which continues to support core operations until the primary site is fully recovered,” Serdyuk tells CSO. By contrast, it’s uncommon in ransomware attacks for the targeted organization to lose its infrastructure. Instead, the damage occurs at the level of applications and data, and data recovery and cybersecurity measures should be prioritized. “In such cases, a disaster recovery site may be necessary but only with the goal of setting up an isolated recovery environment, which serves to protect data integrity, prevent ransomware reinfection, and speed up containment,” Serdyuk says. Volovich adds that organizations should use decryption tools, forensic analysis tools, and threat intelligence platforms. They should also communicate with stakeholders about the breach and the steps taken. A mature backup and recovery strategy with reliable backups will allow for faster recovery. Preparing for disasters requires time, resources, and attention to detail. That said, it’s not unusual for organizations to overlook certain things or underestimate others. It is essential to have a thorough inventory of all IT assets — hardware, software, data, and network resources. “This is a critical starting point for an effective disaster recovery plan, and without knowing exactly what needs to be protected, there is a potential risk of not recovering all the essential data if a disaster strikes,” Butterfield says. His advice is to rank assets based on importance to business functions and start the risk assessment process from there. The risk assessment should be meticulous and should be seen as an ongoing process that accounts for new threats and new technologies that keep emerging. Ramakrishnan goes a step further and recommends appointing a disaster recovery leader, a person tasked with overseeing the planning process. “The leader needs an IT background to understand the challenges, they need solid project management skills and strong business acumen,” he says. Part of their mission is to assemble a team that includes experts from each IT department as well as key stakeholders from critical business units. The disaster recovery leader can push for robust backup and recovery procedures. “Too many companies try to restore from backup only to find that, for one reason or another, the backup hasn’t been working in a while,” Ramakrishnan says. “If there’s one thing I’d like readers to take away from this, it’s that testing your ability to restore in an emergency is a critical part of any backup strategy. If you don’t test your backups and your team’s process for restoring, you’re setting yourself up for failure.” Serdyuk agrees that robust backup and recovery procedures are a must and that more testing should be done, in general. “They [businesses] often conduct irregular or superficial tests, missing broader scenarios like simultaneous cyberattacks, natural disasters, or power outages,” Serdyuk says. These drills should involve participants from all departments, and insights gained from each session should be used to enhance preparedness. Ultimately, whether there is a CISO, CIO or IT manager leading, the people who are part of the process have a crucial role in improving and executing those plans. That is why they should work well together. Ramakrishnan also recommends devising an internal communication plan that “will ensure that minimal time is lost due to the confusion that likely comes when a disaster strikes.” PODCASTS VIDEOS

What is swatting? Criminal harassment falsely involving armed police,https://www.csoonline.com/article/569815/what-is-swatting-unleashing-armed-police-against-your-enemies.html,"Swatting is a form of criminal harassment in which attackers “prank call” law enforcement to trick police into surrounding unsuspecting homes — and the resulting confrontations can go very badly.

Swatting examples Swatting statistics How to prevent swatting Related content Oracle Cloud breach may impact 140,000 enterprise customers New phishing campaign uses scareware to steal Apple credentials Trump shifts cyberattack readiness to state and local governments in wake of info-sharing cuts CISA marks NAKIVO’s critical backup vulnerability as actively exploited Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Swatting is a form of criminal harassment in which attackers try to trick police forces into sending a heavily armed strike force to a victim’s home or business. The term takes its name from SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics), a highly trained police unit that is called on to respond to active shooting scenes. The Los Angeles Police Department, in apress release about a specific swatting attackthat occurred in August 2020, provided this definition of swatting: “The term ‘swatting’ refers to someone who places a false emergency call for service, generally of a nature which causes a large police response.” The LAPD goes on to add that “the ‘swatting’ practice is dangerous and places the community and first responders in harm’s way.” For some attackers, this is the thrill and the purpose of swatting: to cause the victims to fear for their lives as armed police charge into their homes, often with little warning. The police often believe that they themselves are facing an armed and dangerous adversary, producing a volatile scenario that can result in property destruction, injury, and death. Swatting follows a basic and fairly simple pattern. The attackers place a call to a law enforcement agency local to their victim. They report that a particularly gruesome crime or imminent threat is taking place or about to take place at the victim’s home; often, they’ll claim a hostage situation is in progress, and, to make sure the responding law enforcement team is particularly primed for conflict, they may imply that one of the hostages has already been killed, or is about to be. There are a variety of techniques swatters use to pull off their attacks: Doxing:To successfully swat someone, harassers need to know where they live; that’s why swatting goes hand-in-hand withdoxing,the practice of discovering and revealing personal information (like home addresses) of individuals without their consent. Swatters will often begin their quest by seeking to dox their victims, and sometimes doxers will publicly post or sell people’s personal information in the hopes that others will take up the baton and swat them. Social engineering:Swatters often usesocial engineeringtechniques to obtain more information about their intended victims, in addition to their location, in an effort to make the call to law enforcement more convincing and effective. Spoofing:Swatters also need to disguise their own identity, both to make their initial call more believable and to ensure they don’t get in trouble once the deception is revealed. Swatters generally usecaller ID spoofing, a relatively simple technique that makes it appear that their call is coming from somewhere else; if they’ve managed to dox the victim’s phone number, it’s common to try to trick 911 operators into believing the call is coming from the victims themselves, which heightens the realism. Swatters alsomake use of teletypewriter (TTY) relay services, which are intended to relay text messages from deaf or hard-of-hearing users as voice calls to a third party. Because TTY services are required to keep calls and callers confidential, this exploitation adds an extra layer of anonymity to the process. None of these techniques require much by way of resources or technical skills, but they can go a long way towards shielding the perpetrators from consequences. Brian Krebs, author of the Krebs on Security blog and himself an attempted swatting victimtold theNew York Timesthat “like any other type of crime, when the cost is zero and the deterrent is very low, you’ve created a perfect opportunity for people to pour time and resources into that crime.” Because swatting involves making false emergency calls to law enforcement, and the harassment of an individual, swatting is very much illegal at both the state and federal level. Swatters can be charged with a range of offenses, including stalking, internet threats, and wire fraud, in addition to being charge for the crime of calling in fake bomb threats or other false emergencies. Swatting can also be prosecuted as a hate crime in some states when they can be proved to be motivated by prejudice against protected groups. Although swatting doesn’t take much technical acumen to pull off, it first become popular in online, tech-focused spaces, such as among hackers andin the hypercompetitive world of videogaming streams. Because streamers provide an audio or video of themselves along with their gaming stream, if their rivals swatted them, both the attackers and other viewers at home would be able to watch the chaos when police arrived, adding a voyeuristic aspect to the attack.High-profile female streamersin particular found themselves targets. Once established in those communities, the practice spread. For instance, a number ofsocial media executives were swattedby people bitter that they had been banned from various platforms. Some swatters have political agendas as well; one attack, perhaps predictably, targeted a Congresswoman whointroduced a bill to make swatting a felony. Here are five noteworthy examples of swatting: Matthew Wegman.Known in the phone phreaking scene as “Li’l Hacker,” this legally blind teenager was anearly pioneer in swatting. He first came onto the FBI’s radar in 2005 when he swatted the home of a man whose daughter refused to have phone sex with him, but was responsible for numerous other incidents by the time he was convicted and sentenced to prison in 2009. League of Legends terror.A Canadian teen (who was underage and therefore his identity was not released) pled guilty in2015 to 23 charges related to his swatting attacks, many of which were focused on female League of Legends players who refused to accept his online friend requests. He also shut down Disneyland’s Space Mountain with a bomb threat. He chalked his actions up to “boredom,” while his mother said he had been led astray by older members of gaming groups. Sergey Vovnenko vs. Krebs.Security researcher Brian Krebs was the victim ofan attempted swatting attack in 2013. After Krebs infiltrated a Russian-language hacking forum where Vovnenko was active, Vovnenko arranged to have heroin sent to Krebs’s home address, with the plan to sic the cops on him immediately afterwards. (The scheme flopped because Krebs got wind of it and called the police himself.) Tyler Barriss.A small beef within an online game gave rise to one of thehighest-profile cases of swattingin recent memory. Casey Viner and Shane Gaskill got into an argument while playing online; Viner enlisted Tyler Barriss to swat Gaskill; and Gaskill dared them to do it and provided an address that wasn’t actually his. When police arrived at this incorrect address, they shot and killed a resident, Andrew Finch, when he stepped out onto his porch. Barriss had apparently swatted multiple people before this without consequences. Barriss and Viner were both sentenced to prison and Gaskill reached an agreement with prosecutors to avoid prosecution. The officer who killed Finch was not charged. Black Lives Matter Los Angeles.In August 2020, an unknown 911 caller claimed to be holding hostages at the home of Melina Abdullah, a leader in the Black Lives Matter movement in Los Angeles. Policesurrounded her home in an incident that was streamed live on Instagram, though the confrontation ended without violence. The caller said he wanted to “send a message” about his dislike of Black Lives Matter. It’s actually difficult to know how common swatting is, because, despite it being on law enforcement’s radar for more than a decade, it still isn’t a specific category that’s used in the FBI’s database of nationwide crime statistics. Kevin Kolbye, a former FBI special agent who worked on numerous swatting cases and later became assistant police chief for Arlington, Texas,told NBC Newsthat “most of that swatting is called a ‘false police report’ or could be a ‘terroristic threat.’ A lot of those aren’t data that’s grouped together where we have a real national focus.” He also told the Economist that thenumber of swatting cases is on the rise, from about 400 instances in 2011 to more than 1,000 in 2019. Swatting is a difficult technique to prevent so long as heavily armed police strike teams exist with a mission to respond to urgent request for help. There have, however, been attempts to address the problem, coming at it from various angles. One method to reduce swatting attacks is to make potential victims aware of the practice and explain good online identity hygiene techniques. In essence, these are some of the same techniques that would be used to prevent doxing: if you can’t be doxed, you can’t be swatted. Anyone should at a minimum make sure that their home address or phone number isn’t easily discoverable by a simple Google search.Cloudflare emphasizesthat online gamers in particular — who are often young and can be somewhat naive about privacy issues — need to be careful about not revealing any potentially identifying information on in-game chat or gaming forums, since swatting is still common in gaming communities. For further privacy, gamers can connect to the internet via a VPN to hide their IP address, which a determined doxer could use to track them down. On the law enforcement end of the equation, there have been attempts to educate 911 operators about the existence of swatting so that they’re on guard against the practice. Aguide put out by the National Emergency Number Associationoffers some guidance, but notes that “Initially these calls cannot be differentiated from real incidents. The [call center] must process these calls as a normal call, following existing standard operating procedures.” It urges operators to keep the caller on the line as long as possible; “asking specific questions and comparing the response to previously supplied information may be useful.” One police department is taking further steps to be proactive. The city of Seattle allows those worried about being swatted toregister their concerns. While this won’t prevent a swat team from being dispatched to a registered address, it will make the law enforcement officers more aware going into the situation that they may be dealing with a potential hoax.

In a 2023Ponemon surveyof 553 IT professionals, 42% of respondents reported that company executives or family members had been breached by cybercriminals. The attacks resulted in the loss of intellectual property (78% of those breached), loss of customer and business partners (66%), and loss of customer or employee data (27%). The concept of providing digital protection for high-profile figures is not new, but demand for the service is rising, says Brad LaPorte, an advisor with Lionfish Tech Advisors, who established the Digital Executive Protection research category in 2019 while an analyst at Gartner. As early as 2010, he was providing digital protection to high-value military, special agent, and diplomatic personnel as they traveled around the globe to embassies and hotspots. Later, in the private sector, he received numerous inquiries from executives and their companies looking for VIP-level digital protections that went beyond traditional identity-theft monitoring services such as those provided by companies such as LifeLock at the time. “Think of this like identity protection on steroids with a private-investigator approach toward threat intelligence to identify and protect high-value targets,” LaPorte tells CSO. “This includes identifying risk exposures across their home networks, personal devices, and their online accounts for signs of threats.” “Imagine the reactions if someone like Elon Musk tweeted that he was going to run for president, or if the president of ExxonMobil announced that the company was getting out of the oil business. Similarly, consider the impact on executives at companies like Monsanto, which significantly influence our food consumption and often have negative reputations in certain segments.” Digital executive protection services are usually acquired through the office of the CISO or CSO, though executives themselves often acquire the services independently and then involve their CSOs, according to Chris Pierson, CEO ofBlackCloak, which he founded in 2018 with the sole purpose of protecting executives from online threats that can lead to personal and business compromises. Pierson recalls a particularly dicey job when he was chief privacy officer at Royal Bank of Scotland during the time its highly-controversial CEO,Fred Goodwin, came under fire for bad governance, resigned, and ultimately lost his knighthood. “It crossed my mind that this was an attack surface we need to do something about. After that, when I took new CISO jobs, I kept getting calls from executives, board members, even our VCs asking for help around their personal cybersecurity.” The problem: there was no 24/7 monitoring capability that would watch over the executives’ private networks, personal devices, and online footprints, while scanning for external threats on the dark web –and provide response support while also protecting the executives’ personal privacy. He asked himself, “Who’s going to mitigate those risks so that they don’t come back to bite the company, cause reputational damage, leak intellectual property, or access sensitive corporate documents that may be sent to or from their personal email?” While he can’t name his clients, Pierson recalls a case in which a protected executive was ordered to leave his personal phone for inspection in a private room at an airport in the Middle East. He was separated from the device for 15 minutes, so to protect him and his organization, they replaced the phone with a new one. In another case, an IT person at a retail organization set up an executive’s home network and family devices. But then the employee became disgruntled and started siphoning data and using it to try to extort the CEO, while also taking control of the family’s wireless devices. He describes another instance in which an entire executive team at a Fortune 500 retail company received unemployment checks and approvals for low interest loans. It turned out that criminals had found all of the data they needed to conduct the scams through data brokers, social media posts, and on thedark web. To describe a physical threat to an executive, he explains how the BlackCloak team identified an improperly installed security system at a banking CEO’s home that exposed the home’s video feeds and alarms to a public site. He has other stories ofdoxxing,swatting, and geopolitical risks that also impacted executive safety. In all cases, the concierge team helped remedy the problems by working with the executive’s enterprise risk management and response teams under the support of their CISOs. Personal privacy is a big reason some executives may not opt into these services, so the BlackCloak platform ensures that the concierge team and the executive’s organization does not have access or visibility into the executive’s personal data or online activities. Not everyone can afford full-service, VIP-level protection services, says G. Mark Hardy, host of CISO Tradecraft and president of the National Security Corp., a cybersecurity consulting service based in Washington DC. “While everyone could probably use this protection, it’s the high-value targets for bad actors that have the greatest need. Usually, those executives and their organizations are in a better position to afford these protections.” Based on client need, BlackCloak services can include everything from digital privacy protection, personal device protection, home network security, to incident response, a personal SOC, and a “white-glove” client service. The cost for the full concierge service is just under $10,000 per year per executive, family included. If these costs are out of range, such services can at least shrink the external attack surface with threat intelligence and scanning and scraping tools. Many threat intelligence, exposure management, and attack surface management vendors are tailoring offerings to also protect high-value executives, but they don’t include home network and device monitoring or human assistance, according to LaPorte. ZeroFox, normally associated with brand protection, offers a customizableadd-onfor executive protection that starts at $300 a month and covers up to five executives or $500 per month if they want the executives’ families protected. The service, which protects over 40,000 executives, also removes sensitive data and disrupts threat actors where possible. But it does not monitor the executives’ home networks and personal devices. London-based Aon, a$13.5-billionglobal business professional services firm, also offersdigital executive protectionto its business clients, which came about through itsacquisitionof specialized IT services firm, Stroz Friedberg, according to Aaron Cookstra, a threat intelligence director in the AON Cyber Solutions Group. Basic elements include a vulnerability assessment across open sources and social media platforms to gauge the executive’s virtual footprint, combined with deep and dark web scanning for threats, and personal data removal from over 90 personal data aggregator sites “One of the services I find very compelling is removing my personal data from the web,” says Troy Wilkinson, global CISO for the global holding and marketing company, Interpublic Group. “I don’t want my address and phone number out there, but it certainly is. There are services that go out and check the top 100 known data aggregator sites and take down what they can.” His team recently examined the capabilities ofDataminr’srisk discovery platform, which started out as a crisis management and early detection platform. The team especially liked how Dataminr protects traveling executives by monitoring the physical security risks (such as protests and uprisings) in the regions they’re traveling to, along with “cyber risks” (such as threats made on social media). “Executives understand that risk is no longer just physical and that their digital footprint must also be protected,” Wilkinson adds. Even high-profile CISO’s could use additional digital protections, although they are not typically covered under these types of services, experts say. What’s important, they say, is to identify the high-value targets and potential threats against them, and by virtue, to the enterprise. Then research and apply safety measures around them based on their value and the potential for damage should they get breached.

3 reasons users can’t stop making security mistakes — unless you address them,https://www.csoonline.com/article/2132350/3-reasons-why-users-still-make-security-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them.html,"Understanding what’s behind employee security mistakes can help CISOs make meaningful adjustments to their security awareness training strategies. 1. They don’t understand their role in defending 2. They prioritize convenience over security 3. They suffer from alert fatigue Related content Oracle Cloud breach may impact 140,000 enterprise customers About 22k WAB customers impacted by a zero-day attack on a third-party vendor GitHub suffers a cascading supply chain attack compromising CI/CD secrets Not all cuts are equal: Security budget choices disproportionately impact risk Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Risks associated with cybersecurity continue to evolve, but one challenge remains a constant for CISOs: managing human error. Even with advanced solutions and sophisticated protocols in place, employees continue to inadvertently expose sensitive data and systems to cyber threats. Verizon’s 2024 Data Breach Investigations Report (DIBR)analyzed a record-high 30,458 security incidents from 2023, including 10,626 confirmed breaches — a two-fold increase over the year prior. Significantly, it found that more than two-thirds (68%) were attributed to the human element. That’s why it’s critical for CISOs to understand what’s behind employee mistakes when they take an action that compromises security. As Carolin Desirée Toepfer, Cyttraction’s CISO, observes, “What we often forget from a cybersecurity perspective: The people we work with have a completely different background, a different daily routine, and a different approach to technology.” With an understanding of the psychological factors influencing their workforce’s behaviors, CISOs may be better equipped to drive real risk awareness and bring about lasting behavioral change. Most come down to one of three primary causes. Despite training efforts, many employees do not fully understand the need to be vigilant as a first line of defense. Instead, they believe cybersecurity is the responsibility of the IT department and become lax about safeguarding data. As Itamar Shalev, a cybersecurity awareness expert, explains, “They are not as careful as they should be about clicking on suspicious links because they trust their company’s security systems to prevent anything harmful from coming through.” One way to solve this issue is to vary the formats and frequency of security training. Toepfer says doing so will help better convey the importance of consistent vigilance and allow employees to absorb each lesson effectively rather than be overwhelmed with too much at once. “Don’t address the topic once a year or force colleagues to take part in awareness training, but present cybersecurity five to six times in different ways with different links and on different channels,” she says, recommending that specifically targeted videos just 3-15 minutes long be shown to employees every few weeks. A related issue is that users can often be reluctant to report a problem because they fear the consequences when they’ve taken an action that puts the company’s security at risk. Such delays in notification extend the time for malicious actors to cause serious damage. According toVerizon’s DBIR, it takes an average of 55 days for organizations to patch critical vulnerabilities, and that time can translate into serious losses, from costly ransomware attacks, to damage to the company’s reputation. CISOs can address this issue by further fostering a culture where everyone recognizes the essential role they play in maintaining the security of the organization. Instead of contributing to a culture of fear by naming and shaming, CISOs can highlight people who have made smart security decisions and averted risks to serve as role models and turn events into learning experiences. People are naturally inclined to find the fastest possible route at work, and that often translates into taking shortcuts that compromise security for the sake of convenience. Even tech employees are not immune when, for example, importing libraries from public repositories assuming these are safe, as they continue to be used to distribute malware and steal passwords. To avoid these shortcuts that can threaten systems, CISOs can put automated MFA prompts in place to avoid risks due to compromised passwords and restrict access to services that could put data at risk, including generative AI or downloadable libraries of code. CISOs should provide a list of safe alternatives to free services that the company’s developers can refer to for downloadables that have been scanned and certified to be free of malware. Humans tend to go into auto-pilot mode for repetitive tasks and tune out constant alerts, explains cybersecurity advisor Alexandre Blanc. Scammers exploit this by inserting their phishing attempts and other attacks into digital messages that match what employees see all the time. While it’s possible to put up alerts on those, a constant flow of notifications creates alert fatigue. Employees learn to tune out the alarms and can come to ignore warnings for a real threat. Verizon noted in its DBIR, “the most effective controls are typically the ones that leverage the human element along with technical resources.” The good news is that companies are recognizing that fact. Accordingly, Shalev says that many have started to apply “behavioral science techniques such as nudges and reminders to encourage desired security behavior.” Such nudges can prompt employees to pause and evaluate whether digital requests are legitimate before acting — without contributing to alert fatigue. Blanc recommends giving employees the following three questions to work through: Why did I get this message or request for information? Did I ask for it? Can I verify this request through another channel? Users should use out-of-band communication for verification to deter attacks and scams. Contacting those businesses through a phone number or email previously established as legitimate is a good way to ascertain whether or not the message is authorized by the entity it claims. While CISOs can’t eliminate all human risk, they can significantly reduce incidents and promote a cyber-aware culture with a strategy that addresses the psychological drivers behind poor decisions. By forging a transparent, accountability-focused culture, security leaders can foster engaged and informed employees empowered to act as the first line of cybersecurity defense.

AI poisoning is a growing threat — is your security regime ready?,https://www.csoonline.com/article/2139630/ai-system-poisoning-is-a-growing-threat-is-your-security-regime-ready.html,"NIST, security leaders warn that hackers will launch more poisoning attacks as artificial intelligence use increases, testing the strength of today’s security programs NIST issues warning about 4 types of poisoning attacks AI poisoning attacks can come from inside or outside an organization Primary targets will likely be tech companies that make AI systems Preparing a response to AI poisoning now will help protect against what’s coming Defending against the threat to AI systems Related content Developers: apply these 10 mitigations first to prevent supply chain attacks DOGE’s cost-cutting database dives offer cybersecurity pros vital lessons in cloud security That breach cost HOW MUCH? How CISOs can talk effectively about a cyber incident’s toll Australian financial firm hit with lawsuit after massive data breach Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Consulting firm Protiviti recently worked with a client company experiencing an unusual attack: a hacker trying to manipulate the data being fed into one of the company’s AI systems. Company leaders are still unraveling the attack, but Protiviti managing director John Stevenson says the company suspects the hacker was trying to skew the AI system’s output. Such attacks are not new, yet they remain outliers in the cybersecurity world. As the “2024 State of Security” report from software maker Splunk states: “AI poisoning remains a possibility, [but] has yet to become commonplace.” That outlier status, however, is expected to change, with leading security experts predicting that hackers will increasingly target AI systems and, more specifically, willattempt to poison them by corrupting data or the modelsthemselves. CISOs everywhere need to prepare, as organizations of all sizes and types could be targets. “Every company is exposed to this either through their own [in-house developed] AI models or through the third-party AI tools they use,” Stevenson says. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a US agency, warned of what’s to come ina January 2024 paper. Researchers wrote that “poisoning attacks are very powerful and can cause either an availability violation or an integrity violation.” “In particular, availability poisoning attacks cause indiscriminate degradation of the machine learning model on all samples, while targeted and backdoor poisoning attacks are stealthier and induce integrity violations on a small set of target samples,” NIST wrote. The paper highlights four types of poisoning attacks: Availability poisoning, “which indiscriminately impacts the entire machine learning model and, in essence, causes a denial-of-service attack on users of the AI system.” Targeted poisoning, in which hackers “induce a change in the [machine learning] model’s prediction on a small number of targeted samples.” Backdoor poisoning, where “image classifiers can be poisoned by adding a small patch trigger in a subset of images at training time and changing their label to a target class,” with NIST further noting that although “the majority of backdoor poisoning attacks are designed for computer vision applications, this attack vector has been effective in other application domains with different data modalities, such as audio, NLP, and cybersecurity settings.” Andmodel poisoning, attacks that “attempt to directly modify the trained ML model to inject malicious functionality into the model.” NIST and security leaders note that poisoning is in addition to numerous other attack types targeting AI, such as privacy compromises as well as direct and indirect prompt injections. “Deploying AI in your enterprise introduces a new attack surface that’s very different,” says Apostol Vassilev, a NIST research team supervisor and co-author of the NIST paper. “We have seen exploits demonstrated by academics and other researchers trying to point out potential problems, but the more this technology is deployed, the more value there is for hackers to attack it, and that’s why we’re going to get into the more consequential exploits.” He adds: “Already we are starting to see it with an increasing pace.” Security experts say poisoning attacks could be launched by insiders as well as external hackers — as is the case with more conventional cybersecurity attack types. And in another similarity to conventional attack types, “nation-states are probably one of the biggest risks here because they have the ability and resources to invest in this [type of attack],” says David Youssef a managing director at FTI Consulting and leader of the North America incident response efforts for the firm’s cybersecurity practice. Bad actor motivations for poisoning attacks are also familiar, according to security experts, who say hackers may target AI systems for the same reasons they launch other types of cyberattacks, such as to cause disruption or damage an organization. Some say hackers may also use poisoning attacks to gain access to proprietary data or to get money. “Could someone use this for extortion? Absolutely,” says Erik Avakian, technical counselor at Info-Tech Research Group and former state CISO for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. “If a hacker can compromise a system by poisoning, they can use that; they can say, ‘We poisoned the model, now you have to pay us money [to get information on what we did].’” Although motivations like that mean any organization using AI could be a victim, Kayne McGladrey, a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a nonprofit professional association, and field CISO at Hyperproof, says he expects hackers will be more likely to target the tech companies making and training AI systems. But CISOs shouldn’t breathe a sigh of relief, McGladrey says, as their organizations could be impacted by those attacks if they are using the vendor-supplied corrupted AI systems. A recent case illustrates the potential for far-reaching harm in such scenarios. Researchers at tech company JFrog discovered some 100 malicious machine learning models had been uploaded toHugging Face, a public AI model repository. Researchers said in aFebruary 2024 blogthat the malicious ML models could enable threat actors to inject malicious code into users’ machines once the model is loaded, a scenario that could have rapidly compromised an untold number of user environments. Experts say more such incidents are on the horizon. “I’m thinking this is an emergent risk, and once AI technology scales, the poisoning threat will become more apparent,” says Mary Carmichael, managing director of risk advisory at Momentum Technology and a member of both the Emerging Trends Working Group and the Risk Advisory Committee at the governance association ISACA. Security experts and CISOs themselves say many organizations are not prepared to detect and respond to poisoning attacks. “We’re a long way off from having truly robust security around AI because it’s evolving so quickly,” Stevenson says. He points to the Protiviti client that suffered a suspected poisoning attack, noting that workers at that company identified the possible attack because its “data was not synching up, and when they dived into it, they identified the issue. [The company did not find it because] a security tool had its bells and whistles going off.” He adds: “I don’t think many companies are set up to detect and respond to these kinds of attacks.” AFebruary 2024 reportfrom ISC2, a nonprofit organization offering training and certifications for cybersecurity professionals, sheds light on whether CISOs feel prepared for what’s ahead. The report found that 75%of more than 1,100 respondents said they are moderately to extremely concerned that AI will be used for cyberattacks or other malicious activities, with deepfakes, misinformation, and social engineering being the top three concerns for cyber professionals. Despite that high level of concern, only 60% said they feel confident in their ability to lead their organization’s secure adoption of AI. Moreover, 41% said they have minimal or no expertise in securing AI and ML technology. Meanwhile, a mere 27% said their organization has formal policies in place on the safe and ethical use of AI. “The average CISO isn’t skilled in AI development and doesn’t have AI skills as a core competency,” says Jon France, CISO with ISC2. Even if they were AI experts, they would likely face challenges in determining whether a hacker had launched a successful poisoning attack. As Vassilev explains, AI system owners and users would struggle to detect hackers, who can turn on and off behaviors without being detected. And they wouldn’t be able to look at the source code and find a trigger once a model is poisoned. The non-deterministic nature of generative AI further challenges detection and response, he adds. As has long been the case in security, no single tool is going to stop poisoning attacks. Similarly, long-standing security practices can mitigate risk, detect anomalies and speed recovery, experts said. They advise a multilayered defense strategy that includes a strong access and identity management program, asecurity information and event management(SIEM) system, and anomaly detection tools. “So, you know if someone has accessed your systems,” Avakian says. Strong data governance practices as well as monitoring and oversight of AI tools are also musts, Avakian adds, “so you know what’s not real, what’s not good.” So, too, is good vendor management to ensure that the vendors providing AI tools are doing what they should to prevent their products from falling victim to poisoning attacks, Carmichael says. Vassilev says CISOs should work alongside other executives to identify and understand the risks (including poisoning attacks) associated with the AI tools they’re using, devise strategies to mitigate the risks that are too high, and articulate the residual risk that they’re willing to accept. CISOs and their organizations should also know the provenance of the models they use and the lineage of their data, Vassilev says. The NIST Adversarial Machine Learning paper provides more detailed mitigation strategies as well as more details on poisoning and other types of attacks. Some security leaders advise CISOs to add talent specifically trained in AI security to their teams, too. “This work requires advanced data scientists, teams who know how to evaluate training sets and models; it’s not going to be done by your average SOC teams,” Youssef says, adding that chief AI officers and CISOs should be working together on governance and security plans. “The typical protections we have in place today will not be enough, but the right approach isn’t to avoid AI but instead to understand the risk, work with the right people, evaluate it properly and take steps to minimize it.” More on AI in cybersecurity: AI agents can find and exploit known vulnerabilities, study shows Where in the world is your AI?

Here’s how cyber teams can cope Not all cuts are equal: Security budget choices disproportionately impact risk Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  When a large company announces the acquisition of another organization, it’s often perceived as just being a financial transaction. However, themerger and acquisition(M&A) process is far more complex and can help uncover various aspects of both businesses involved. Amid the rush to finalize a deal, one critical area that’s historically been overlooked but is essential to any M&A deal is cybersecurity. This is particularly important since the organizations being acquired are typically smaller, and may lack the cybersecurity resources necessary to ensure their protection. A survey byCynetpreviously indicated that small cybersecurity teams face a greater risk of being attacked than larger enterprises. “I think the M&A process is relatively well understood and financial modelling and financial due diligence is obviously done very well,” Deloitte Australia risk advisory partner Ian Blatchford tells CSO. “I think not enough attention is paid to cyber due diligence. There’s usually a very cursory glance at cyber risk, in terms of the way their systems are operating and secondly, what risk are we taking on board … but usually it’s a checklist and very low down the M&A activity checklist.” However, KPMG Australia cyber lead partner Gergana Winzer believes there has been a measured shift over the last couple of years in how much attention companies are paying to cybersecurity during an M&A transaction. She believes high-profile breaches have helped raise awareness about the importance of cybersecurity. Gartner reportedthat by 2025, 60% of organizations will use cybersecurity risk as a primary determinant when engaging in M&A activity. “As a consequence even organizations that we consider being part of the mid-market segment – so not organizations that have huge budgets for cyber – even those types of organizations are starting to realize that they need to have controls in place, they need to have good cybersecurity posture from a technical perspective, but also good cybersecurity maturity for them to be competitive in the market and even survive,” Winzer tells CSO. A failure to consider cybersecurity when it comes to engaging in an M&A deal, as Winzer put it, is like driving blind without any mirrors. “You can be very easily attacked and become prey to cyber attackers, and if that were to happen what’s at stake is business operations, being able to run the company as profitably as possible, but also to suffer disruption and suffer a financial loss,” she explains. “There can also be very specific impacts on occupational health and safety. As an example, depending on the type of organization and industry, if it’s the healthcare industry, there may actually be an impact on patients and people who need vital support.” There are a few cybersecurity risks that M&As bring to haunt CISOs. Experts from major consulting firms have shared some of the main ones CISOs should be aware of and make sure their CEOs and boards are on top of before the process begins. These include ensuring that technology and governance are up to date, checking all third-party agreements and services to ensure they meet necessary cybersecurity requirements, being aware of opportunism by cyber criminals, and watch out for dormant attackers. An obvious risk, according to CyberCX financial services lead Shameela Gonzalez, is when two companies are trying tomerge two different technology stacks. “It’s really important to understand what risks could be created as a result of merging and consolidating those, and how do you still make sure that the coverage you once had as a standalone entity maintains itself once you’ve now incorporated a whole new technology stack,” she says, pointing out that one company is likely to have a better cyber posture than the other. A prominent example of this was back in late 2018 when the Marriott hotel chain announced one of itsreservations systems had been compromised, two years after it had purchased Starwood. Following investigations, it was revealed that when Starwood was acquired, Marriott continued to use the IT infrastructure that it inherited, which unknowingly had been breached by hackers and infected with malware. As a result, an estimated 339 million guest records, including credit card and passport details, were compromised. Gonzalez also points out that merging and acquiring companies might be at further cyber risk from a governance standpoint. “How do you maintain, outside of tech, the governance and the controls? So much of cyber-risk management is not just tech. Again, mature organizations and highly regulated organizations have lived and breathed this for some time, but some of those enterprises that have not had the same regulatory scrutiny may make the mistake of thinking that ‘as long as I’ve bought a couple of cyber tools, therefore I’m protected’,” she says. “But actually, in the midst of an M&A, your governance is probably going to be more critical than ever because it is the strength of your risk-management process, it’s the strength of your people capability and your process capability on identifying those grey areas you might not immediately pick up on.” But it’s not just the cyber posture of the two companies involved in an M&A deal that needs to be considered, but also third-party providers. According to Blatchford, some of the common questions that need to be asked when conducting cyber due diligence before completing an acquisition deal include who all the third-party suppliers are and what’s the residual risk in the supply chain. A recent report bySecurityScorecardrevealed that the exploitation of trusted third parties continues to be a prevalent security concern. The research indicated that 98% of organizations are affiliated with a third party that has experienced a breach. Furthermore, third-party attacks have led to 29% of breaches. “You can make the general assumption that large organizations have resourcing and investment in cybersecurity, so it’s not as easy for cyber attackers in this day and age to go after them,” Gonzalez says. “But vulnerable third parties are a great avenue for cyber attackers to adjacently make their way into larger organizations and cause that same level of disruption.” Additionally, Gonzalez points out that when a company goes public about their intention to acquire or merge with another, it signals to cyber attackers as a potential opportunity to attack. She believes if organizations are aware of this, there’s an opportunity to take a proactive approach to cybersecurity, rather than carry out cyber due diligence as a prerequisite to an acquisition being finalised. “If an attacker were to see the news publicly announced, what would they assume about us? One easy assumption most attackers would make is that your eyes are off the tools, you are distracted, your investment is going to be focused on everything else except cybersecurity,” she says. “Once you have that in your mind, you can really prepare yourself and arm yourself to prevent against that kind of mentality and really put the right barriers up that would circumvent a cyber attacker from being opportunistic around it.” M&A activities are also a perfect incubator for serious cyberattacks, Gonzalez warns, pointing out how one previous case she had worked on saw a cyber attacker “literally penetrated [the company being acquired] the day before”. “So many threat actors are sitting in organizations just dormant, and secretly hiding within your network. They’re learning about your business and your operations, and they’ve amassed a significant amount of knowledge about you …. the last thing we want is a dormant threat actor sitting in one of these entities waiting for the merger to happen and then you’ve just expanded their attack surface,” she says. But of course, it’s nearly impossible these days for any organization to keep attackers at bay all the time. Blatchford’s advice for companies is to figure out what level of cyber risk they’re willing to take on. Part of that decision, he says, will involve considering what the cost of remediation is likely to be if an attack were to occur, and what contractual obligations the acquiring company will be exposed to post-acquisition. “Cyber risk is a risk like anything else that needs to be paid attention to, but cyber risk does come with some pretty significant consequences if got wrong,” Blatchford says. “So, if I acquire something and there’s a big data leak out there, who takes responsibility for any penalties and enforcement that may come down the line? More often than not, when a cyber breach is detected, it may have happened months ago.” On the flip side, for the company being acquired, Blatchford remarks how important it is to improve their cyber posture, warning that failure to do this can jeopardise a company’s sale value. One of the most prominent examples of this was when Verizonslashed Yahoo’s deal priceby a massive $350 million during the evaluation phase due to Yahoo’s security breaches. “[Cyber risk] is definitely a negotiation tool. Ultimately, if you’re the acquirer, you’re taking on some kind of risk and for that risk, there needs to be a premium or cost associated with that. And if you have to do an uplift, you’re going to have to spend money and that may have not been factored in on the purchase price,” Blatchford says.

8 critical lessons from the Change Healthcare ransomware catastrophe,https://www.csoonline.com/article/2140608/8-critical-lessons-from-the-change-healthcare-ransomware-catastrophe.html,"From fundamental security mistakes and strategic shortcuts, to emerging industry trends, Change Healthcare’s security meltdown provides ample fodder for thought on how not to be the next high-profile victim. MFA is essential Segment your systems M&A activity requires cyber due diligence ‘Self-insure’ at your peril Living with the enemy Double jeopardy — and the debate over ransom payments Healthcare increasingly under attack Ransomware as vibrant as ever Related content Report on ransomware attacks on Fortinet firewalls also reveals possible defenses The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time The state of ransomware: Fragmented but still potent despite takedowns Ransomware goes postal: US healthcare firms receive fake extortion letters Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Lessons are beginning to cohere from Change Healthcare’s disastrous ransomware attack that starkly illustrated the fragility of the healthcare sector, prompting calls for regulatory action. The February attack disrupted insurance claims processing across the US, creating chaos for clinics, pharmacies, and patients left unable to fulfil pre-authorized prescriptions or medical treatments covered by insurance. The flow of payments to healthcare providers processed by Change Healthcare was brought to an abrupt halt as systems were taken offline in response to the attack. Smaller healthcare providers and rural pharmacies in particular experienced huge revenue losses because of the attack with some taken close to insolvency. In the end, the attack exposed personal data ofpotentially a third of all US citizensand cost parent company UnitedHealth Group (UHG) more than $872 million todeal with the attack and the disruption it caused. Part of these costs has involved offering accelerated payments and no-interest, no-fee loans to thousands of providers. Another portion is earmarked for incident response and completely rebuilding Change Healthcare’s systems from the ground up. Revenue loss included, it is estimated that the attack willcost UHG over $1 billion. In response to the attack, US politicians have called formandated baseline cybersecurity standards in the health sector, as well as better information sharing. They have also raised concerns that industry consolidation is increasing cyber risk. Overall, the ransomware attack on Change Healthcare, which UHG acquired for nearly $8 billion in 2022, illustrates how often poor security controls come up as a factor in ransomware attacks. Following is a look at several lessons learned in the wake of the attack. During Congressional testimony in early May(pdf), UHG CEO Andrew Witty said that criminals used compromised credentials toremotely access a Change Healthcare Citrix portal, technology that allowed remote access to desktops, on or around Feb. 12. The portal wasunprotected with multi-factor authentication (MFA), a basic enterprise security control. Whilenot entirely bullet-proof, MFA has long been considered a best practice for securing systems against credential attacks. It is highly likely that MFA not being enabled played a key role in attackers being able to remotely access the systems at Change Healthcare — making the incident highly avoidable and a massive failure to adopt even the most basic cybersecurity principals, according to Tony Anscombe, chief security evangelist at ESET. “What we don’t know is the reason why there was no MFA; was it incompetence, a budget limitation, user demand, or something else?” Anscombe said. Trevor Dearing, director of critical infrastructure at Illumio, commented: “Too often a lack of efficient security controls is a factor in a successful ransomware attack. Whether that is a lack of MFA controls, an unpatched web portal, or a DLP [Data Loss Prevention] system with an elapsed licence, any hole can create a massive breach.” Having gained a foothold on Change Healthcare’s systems, the attackers then moved laterally and exfiltrated data before deploying the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware nine days later on Feb. 21. As such, another issue raised in many post-breach reports is that Change Healthcare’s systems suffered from a lack of segmentation, which enables easy lateral movement of the attack. This leads to the exposure of critical assets to the attackers, according to Dearing. Segmentation involves breaking down a large network of systems into smaller, isolated subsegments, making it easier for security teams to secure and monitor IT assets by preventing lateral attacks such as the one used against Change Healthcare. Segmentation has long been key part of defense-in-depth strategies. The Change Healthcare ransomware breach also offers lessons about due diligence post-merger of acquired systems. UHG acquired Change Healthcare, theUS’s biggest clearinghouse for medical claims, in October 2022, after a legal battle with the US Department of Justice, which argued the acquisition would harm competition in the markets for health insurance and technology used to process health insurance claims, giving UHG, the largest US health insurance provider, access to its competitors’ data. As a result of the acquisition, Change Healthcare was merged with UHG’s Optum health services company, with Steven Martin, Optum’s CIO and CTO and UHG’s CISO, leading security operations. Mergers and acquisitionscreate new cyber threats because they involve the integration of systems, data, and processes from different organizations, each with its own security protocols and potential vulnerabilities. “During this transition, cybercriminals can exploit discrepancies in security measures, gaps in IT governance, and the increased complexity of managing merged IT environments,” Aron Brand, CTO of CTERA told CSOonline. “Additionally, the heightened sharing of sensitive information between parties provides more opportunities for data breaches.” Given the complexity and risks involved, a comprehensive due diligence checklist is essential for both healthcare and non-healthcare organizations during mergers, Brand advised. “This should include exhaustive security audits to evaluate the acquired company’s cybersecurity posture, identify vulnerabilities, and assess their incident response capabilities,” according to Brand. “For example, the breach at Change Healthcare might have been mitigated if thorough assessments had addressed the lack of robust MFA controls.” Aaron Walton, a threat intel analyst at Expel, agreed. “From the hearing, we didn’t learn what caused the delay, but it suggests that Change was not brought up to speed with all the same security policies as UnitedHealth Group,” he said. “Had Change implemented UnitedHealth’s upgrades, processes, and policies, it might have addressed some of the issues that led to the attack on Change Healthcare, such as the lack of MFA.” In response to questions during Congressional hearings,UHG chief exec Witty admitted that the company was “self-insured”for cyber incidents. Cyber insurance providers will mandate a high level of risk mitigation before they approve a policy. For many organizations, this alone provides incentive to ensure hardened systems. And for those who forego insurance, that goes double. “The option to self-insure and accept the risk, the stance Change Healthcare appears to have adopted, should not be at the expense of cybersecurity measures,” ESET’s Anscombe told CSOonline. “I think it unlikely that insurance was not available due to the increased risk — everything is insurable; it’s just about the cost of the premium.” Anscombe added: “Not insuring as premiums would be too high due to the risk because of non-compliant cybersecurity measures is unforgivable as it puts the business, customers, partners and many others at risk unnecessarily.” Businesses should adopt a stance of being cyber risk insurance compliant or better still compliant with a recognized cybersecurity framework, Anscombe advised. The attackers loitered on the Change Healthcare systems for over a week (nine days) before deploying ransomware. This kind of delay is by no means atypical in enterprise attacks, according to experts. The time taken for attackers to escalate privileges and move laterally in compromised networks does not mean there’s a higher chance of being discovered. This is because attackers take pains to disguise their activities, for example by abusing legitimate programs and commands that will easily blend in with regular, expected traffic. Silobreaker’s Baumgaertner commented: “Ransomware groups typically spend a very long time within a victim’s system, taking the time to move laterally within the network to cause the most amount of damage possible. In addition, the longer they stay undetected within a network, the more time they have to find and steal sensitive data.” While it is hard to say whether Change Healthcare could have detected the attackers on their systems as they escalated their movements, these facts about how ransomware attacks progress should be taken under advisement when devising strategies to combat them. UHG chief exec Witty confirmed during his congressional testimony that the healthcare conglomerate had paid the equivalent of $22M in Bitcoin as ransom to cybercriminals from the BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware group. BlackCat/ALPHV subsequently pulled off an exit scam and disappeared with the money,reportedly cheatingits affiliate Nichy out of its share. That Change Healthcare paid the ransom has reignited the wider debate of whether it’s permissible to pay out on the extortionate demands of cybercriminals, especially as paying the ransom does not guarantee attackers will delete stolen data or refrain from future attacks. ESET’s Anscombe commented: “The decision to pay a ransomware demand should be made by a court, in the same way some medical decisions are taken by the courts. “However, it would appear the decision in most payment cases is purely financial, reducing business disruption and the ongoing task of rebuilding systems to recover,” he concluded. CTERA’s Brand told CSOonline: “Recent surveys show thatdouble extortion — where attackers demand a ransom and threaten to release stolen data — is part of 77% of ransomware attacks. Ransom payments can also incentivize cybercriminals to target other organizations too, creating the ethical dilemma of perpetuating the cycle of ransomware attacks.” In the end, paying the ransom failed to protect UHG from secondary attempts at extortion. In April, cybercriminals from the RansomHub group threatened to leak portions of 6TB of sensitive data stolen from the breach of Change Healthcare, and obtained through Nichy, according to ananalysis by security vendor Forescout. An estimated one in three Americans had their sensitive data exposed as a result of the attack. Such secondary scams are becoming increasingly commonplace and healthcare providers are particularly at risk, according to compliance experts. Victoria Hordern, a partner at international law firm Taylor Wessing’s technology, IP, and information team, told CSOonline: “A health data leak is a tantalizing prospect for a cybercriminal intending to carry out a ransomware attack since they know that a healthcare body will be paralyzed if it can’t access data to provide patient care.” Hordern continued: “Where there is a multiplication of systems and a variety of different parties involved (i.e. patients, healthcare providers, tech support), there are also more points of weakness and vulnerability where bad actors can seek to gain entry into and control systems.” The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) isinvestigating whether a breach of protected health information occurredin assessing whether either UHG or Change Healthcare violated strict healthcare sector privacy regulations. This investigation remains ongoing. The Change Healthcare attack has coincided with a number of attacks on healthcare companies of late, includingAscension,London Drugs,Cencora, andSynnovis. ALPHV’s apparent exit scam and the emergence of RansomHub has done little to change the fundamental drivers in the lucrative ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) market, according to experts. Hannah Baumgaertner, head of research at Silobreaker, said: “ALPHV’s exit scam took place around the same time as the law enforcement action that took down LockBit, resulting in the two most-active ransomware-as-a-service groups no longer being operational.” Baumgaertner warned: “While one might expect this to mean fewer ransomware attacks will occur, this has not been the case.” Due to the nature of RaaS operations, any affiliates that previously worked with ALPHV will only have gone on to find a new operation to work with. Meanwhile the principal players behind ALPHV will likely work on a new project under a different name, according to Baumgaertner. There has been more than a threefold (264%) increase in ransomware attacks over the past five years, according to the HSS. Meanwhile, ransomware now tops the list of CISO’s biggest perceived threats, according to Proofpoint’s recentVoice of the CISOsurvey. CSOonline invited UHG to comment on lessons it has learned from its investigation into the Change Healthcare ransomware attack. We’re yet to hear back but will update this story as soon as more information comes to hand.

In other words, software is identified as malware based on itsintended malicious use,rather than a particular technique or technology used to build it. This means that the question of, say, what the difference is between malware and a virus misses the point a bit: a virus is a type of malware, so all viruses are malware (but not every piece of malware is a virus). Malware has a long, storied history, dating back to infected floppy disks swapped by Apple II hobbyists in the 1980s and theMorris Wormspreading across Unix machines in 1988. Someother high-profile malware attacksover the years have included: ILOVEYOU, a worm that spread like wildfire in 2000 and did more than $15 billion in damage SQL Slammer, which ground internet traffic to a halt within minutes of its first rapid spread in 2003 Conficker, a worm that exploited unpatched flaws in Windows and leveraged a variety of attack vectors – from injecting malicious code to phishing emails – to ultimately crack passwords and hijack Windows devices into abotnet. Zeus, a late ’00s keylogger Trojan that targeted banking information CryptoLocker, the first widespread ransomware attack, whose code keeps getting repurposed in similar malware projects Stuxnet, an extremely sophisticated worm that infected computers worldwide but only did real damage in one place: the Iranian nuclear facility at Natanz, where it destroyed uranium-enriching centrifuges, the mission it was built for by U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies Ryuk, ransomware that targets vulnerable organizations that are likely to pay a ransom, including hospitals and governments. It is typically distributed via the TrickBot trojan. For a deep dive into the history of malware, see11 infamous malware attacks: The first and the worst. Malware infections happen in two phases: First there is the initial infection (how the malware gets onto a computer or network) and then the malware spreads. According to Mandiant’sM-Trends reportfor 2024, exploits were the top initial infection vector in 2023, used in 38% of attacks, followed by phishing (17%), prior compromise (15%), stolen credentials (10%), and brute force (6%) to round out the top 5. Foundry You’ve probably heard the wordsvirus, trojan,andwormused interchangeably. In fact, the terms describe three different kinds of malware, which are distinguished from each other by the process by which they reproduce and spread. Awormis a standalone piece of malicious software that reproduces itself and spreads from computer to computer. Worms’ creators build in knowledge of operating system vulnerabilities, and a worm program seeks these out on computers that it can reach from wherever it’s running and makes copies of itself on those insecure machines. Some of the very first worms were designed to copy themselves to floppy disks and other removable media, then copy themselves again when that disk was inserted into a new computer, but today most worms scan for vulnerable computers connected to their host via a corporate network or the internet. Avirusis a piece of computer code that inserts itself within the code of another standalone program, then forces that program to take malicious action and spread itself. The infected program propagates itself in some of the same ways that a worm does, by searching for vulnerabilities on other computers it can reach via the internet or a local network. But the virus code is lurking inside programs that look legitimate, so there are other vectors by which it could it spread: if a hacker can infect an application at the source, an application that includes virus code could be available for download from open source repositories, app stores, or even the software maker’s own servers. Atrojanis a program that cannot activate itself but masquerades as something the user wants and tricks them into opening it viasocial engineeringtechniques. Often trojans arrive as email attachments with names like “salary.xls” or “resume.doc”, with the malicious code lurking as a Microsoft Office macro. Once it’s running, one of its first jobs is to propagate itself, so it might hijack your email client and send out more copies of itself to potential victims. Malware can also be installed on a computer “manually” by the attackers themselves, either by gaining physical access to the computer or using privilege escalation to gain remote administrator access. While some attackers might create malware as an intellectual exercise or for the thrill of destruction, most are motivated by financial gain. They could be looking for banking passwords or access to secrets they can sell or exploit, or they also could be looking to gain control of your computer and use it as a launching pad for aDDoS attack. Once malware is executing on your computer, it can do a number of things, ranging from simply making it unusable to taking control out of your hands and putting your remote attacker in charge. Malware can also send back information about sensitive data to its creators. Malware can also be part of a politically motivated attack.Hactivistsmight use malware in their campaigns against companies or governments, and state-sponsored hackers create malware as well. In fact, two high-profile malware waves were almost certainly started by national intelligence services:Stuxnetwas created by the U.S. and Israel to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program, whileNotPetyamay have begun as a Russian cyberattack on Ukrainian computers that quickly spread beyond its intended targets (including back into Russia). There are a number of different ways of categorizing malware; the first is by how the malicious software spreads. We covered this in the section above on how malware infections happen. Another way to categorize malware is by what itdoesonce it has successfully infected its victim’s computers. There are a wide range of potential attack techniques used by malware: Spyware, as the name implies, is software that spieson your behavior as you use your computer, and on the data you send and receive, usually with the purpose of sending that information to a third party. Akeyloggeris a specific kind of spyware that records all the keystrokes a user makes—great for stealing passwords. Arootkitis malware that targets the underlying operating system to give the attacker ultimate control. It gets its name because it’s a kit of tools that (generally illicitly) gainroot access(administrator-level control, in Unix terms) over the target system, and use that power to hide their presence. Adwareis malware that forces your browser to redirect to web advertisements, which often themselves seek to download further, even more malicious software. AsThe New York Timesnotes, adware often piggybacks onto tempting “free” programs like games or browser extensions. Ransomwareis a flavor of malware that encrypts your hard drive’s files and demands a payment, usually in Bitcoin, in exchange for the decryption key. Several high-profile malware outbreaks of the last few years, such asPetya, areransomware. Without the decryption key, it’s mathematically impossible for victims to regain access to their files. So-calledscarewareis a sort of shadow version of ransomware; it claims to have taken control of your computer and demands a ransom, but actually is just usingtricks like browser redirect loopsto make it seem as if it’s done more damage than it really has, and unlike ransomware can be relatively easily disabled. Cryptojackingis another way attackers can force you to supply them with Bitcoin—only it works without you necessarily knowing. Thecrypto mining malwareinfects your computer and uses your CPU cycles to mine Bitcoin for your attacker’s profit. The mining software may run in the background on your operating system or even as JavaScript in a browser window. Malvertisingis the use of legitimate ads or ad networks to covertly deliver malware to unsuspecting users’ computers. For example, a cybercriminal might pay to place an ad on a legitimate website. When a user clicks on the ad, code in the ad either redirects them to a malicious website or installs malware on their computer. In some cases, the malware embedded in an ad might execute automatically without any action from the user, a technique referred to as a “drive-by download.” Aremote access trojan (RAT)is malware that gives an attacker control of a victim’s computer, similar to how legitimate remote access software allows helpdesk employees to take over users’ desktops to fix issues, essentially, rootkits that propagate like Trojans. Adownloaderis a type of Trojan that, as the name suggests, downloads other pieces of malware (sometimes in multiples). Polymorphic malware, also known as mutating malware, changes to avoid detection by antivirus and intrusion detection software. The Storm Worm is one such example. Any specific piece of malware has both a means of infection and a behavioral category. So, for instance,WannaCryis a ransomware worm. And a particular piece of malware might have different forms with different attack vectors: for instance, theEmotetbanking malware has been spotted in the wild as both atrojan and a worm. A look at the Center for Internet Security’stop 10 malware offenders for Q4 of 2023gives you a good sense of the types of malware in use today. NanoCore and Gh0st, are RATs, CoinMiner is cryptocurrency malware, and SocGholish and RogueRaticate are downloaders. In a word, yes, malware affects mobile devices and, according to Kaspersky, the threat is growing. In 2023,attacks on mobile devicesincreased 52% over the prior year, with adware accounting for 40.8% of all threats detected. Pegasus, mobile spyware that targets both iOS and Android, is on CIS’s top malware offenders list. Some other common types of mobile malware are banking malware, mobile ransomware, and mobile adware. 52% From 2022 to 2023,attacks on mobile devicesincreased 52%, making up 40.8% of all threats detected, according to antivirus vendor Kaspersky. Mobile malware in the news: Over 60,000 Android apps infected with adware-pushing malware Guerrilla malware is preinfected on 8.9 million Android devices, Trend Micro says Espionage campaign loads VPN spyware on Android devices via social media Android-based banking Trojan Nexus now available as malware-as-a-service Russia points finger at US for iPhone exploit campaign that also hit Kaspersky Lab Apple patches exploits used in spy campaign ‘Operation Triangulation’ It’s fully possible—and perhaps even likely—that your system will be infected by malware at some point despite your best efforts. How can you tell for sure? Security expert Roger Grimes has a great guide ontelltale signs you’ve been hacked, which can range from a sudden decline in your computer’s performance to unexpected movements of your mouse pointer. He’s also written a deep dive into how to diagnose yourhow to detect malware on Windows PCsthat you might find helpful. When you get to the level of corporate IT, there are also more advanced visibility tools you can use to see what’s going on in your networks and detect malware infections. Most forms of malware use the network to either spread or send information back to their controllers, so network traffic containssignals of malware infectionthat you might otherwise miss; there are a wide range ofnetwork monitoring toolsout there, with prices ranging from a few dollars to a few thousand. There are alsoSIEM tools, which evolved from log management programs; these tools analyze logs from various computers and appliances across your infrastructure looking for signs of problems, including malware infection. SIEM vendors range from industry stalwarts like IBM and HP Enterprise to smaller specialists like Splunk and Alien Vault. Much of malware prevention comes down to good cyber hygiene. At minimum, you should be taking these 7 steps: Provide regular security awareness training for users Have a solid patch management program Keep your software updated Keep your asset inventory up-to-date Perform regular vulnerability assessments Monitoring network traffic Keep good backups With spam andphishingemail consistently one of the primary vectors by which malware infects computers, one of the best ways to prevent malware is make sure your email systems are locked down tight—and your users know how to spot danger. We recommend a combination of carefully checking attached documents and restricting potentially dangerous user behavior—as well as just familiarizing your users with common phishing scams so that their common sense can kick in. When it comes to more technical preventative measures, there are anumber of steps you can take, including keeping all your systems patched and updated, keeping an inventory of hardware so you know what you need to protect, and performing continuous vulnerability assessments on your infrastructure. For ransomware attacks in particular, one way to be prepared is toalways make backups of your files, ensuring that you’ll never need to pay a ransom to get them back if your hard drive is encrypted. Antivirus software is the most widely known product in the category of malware protection products; despite “virus” being in the name, most offerings take on all forms of malware. While high-end security pros dismiss it as obsolete, it’s still the backbone of basic anti-malware defense. Today’sbest antivirus softwareis from vendors Kaspersky Lab, Symantec and Trend Micro, according to recent tests by AV-TEST. When it comes to more advanced corporate networks,endpoint securityofferings providedefense in depth against malware. They provide not only the signature-based malware detection that you expect from antivirus, but anti-spyware, personal firewall, application control and other styles of host intrusion prevention.

You can count on cyber criminals to follow the money. They will target victims depending on likelihood of delivering their malware successfully and size of potential payout. If you look at malware trends over the past few years, you will see some fluctuation in terms of the popularity of certain types of malware and who the most common victims are—all driven by what the criminals believe will have the biggest ROI. The June, 2024 edition of BlackBerry’s Global Threat Intelligence Report found thatnew malware increased 40%in the first quarter of 2024 over the previous quarter and despitehigh-profile takedownsransomware remains a significant threat, with LockBit, Hunters International, and 8Base being the most active groups globally. Recentresearch from cybersecurity firm Mandiant, based on investigations of targeted attack activity the company conducted in 2023, indicate some interesting shifts in malware tactics and targets. These include: Attackers are very focused on avoiding detection with the goal of remaining on networks as long as possible. Despite this, average dwell time dropped from 16 days in 2022 to10 daysin 2023. This can be attributed to an increase in ransomware attacks, which typically have a lower dwell time than other types of malware. Ransomware comprised23%of Mandiant investigations in 2023, up from 18% in 2022 Attackers engaging in espionage and financially-motivated attacks continue to leverage zero-day vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities inMOVEitfile transfer,Oracle E-Business Suite, andBarracuda Email Security Gatewayswere the most leveraged by attackers. More than one-third of attacks (36%) were financially motivated. Financial services firms were the most highly targeted by attackers, comprising17.3%of Mandiant’s investigations, followed by business and professional services (13.3), high tech (12.4%), retail and hospitality (8.6%), and healthcare (8.1%).

For example, instead of trying to find a software vulnerability, a social engineer might call an employee and pose as an IT support person, trying to trick the employee into divulging his password. Famous hackerKevin Mitnick helped popularize the term ‘social engineering’in the ’90s, although the idea and many of the techniques have been around as long as there have been scam artists. Even if you’ve got all the bells and whistles when it comes to securing your data center, your cloud deployments, your building’s physical security, and you’ve invested in defensive technologies, have the right security policies and processes in place and measure their effectiveness and continuously improve, still a crafty social engineer can weasel his way right through (or around). The phrase “social engineering” encompasses a wide range of behaviors, and what they all have in common is that they exploit certain universal human qualities: greed, curiosity, politeness, deference to authority, and so on. While some classic examples of social engineering take place in the “real world”—a man in a FedEx uniform bluffing his way into an office building, for example—much of our daily social interaction takes place online, and that’s where most social engineering attacks happen as well. For instance, you might not think ofphishingorsmishingas types of social engineering attacks, but both rely on tricking you—by pretending to be someone you trust or tempting you with something you want—into downloadingmalwareonto your device. This brings up another important point, which is that social engineering can represent a single step in a larger attack chain. A smishing text uses social dynamics to entice you with a free gift card, but once you tap the link and download malicious code, your attackers will be using their technical skills to gain control of your device and exploit it. A good way to get a sense of what social engineering tactics you should look out for is to know about what’s been used in the past. We’ve got all the details in anextensive article on famous social engineering attacks, but for the moment let’s focus on three social engineering techniques — independent of technological platforms — that have been successful for scammers in a big way. Offer something sweet.As any con artist will tell you, the easiest way to scam a mark is to exploit their own greed. This is the foundation of the classic Nigerian 419 scam, in which the scammer tries to convince the victim to help get supposedly ill-gotten cash out of their own country into a safe bank, offering a portion of the funds in exchange. These “Nigerian prince” emails have been a running joke for decades, but they’re still an effective social engineering technique that people fall for: in 2007 the treasurer of a sparsely populated Michigan county gave $1.2 million in public funds to such a scammer in the hopes of personally cashing in. Another common lure is the prospect of a new, better job, which apparently is something far too many of us want: in a hugely embarrassing 2011 breach, the security company RSA was compromised when at least two low-level employees opened a malware file attached to a phishing email with the file name “2011 recruitment plan.xls.” Fake it till you make it.One of the simplest — and surprisingly most successful — social engineering techniques is to simply pretend to be your victim. In one of Kevin Mitnick’s legendary early scams, he got access to Digital Equipment Corporation’s OS development servers simply by calling the company, claiming to be one of their lead developers, and saying he was having trouble logging in; he was immediately rewarded with a new login and password. This all happened in 1979, and you’d think things would’ve improved since then, but you’d be wrong: in 2016, a hacker got control of a U.S. Department of Justice email address and used it to impersonate an employee, coaxing a help desk into handing over an access token for the DoJ intranet by saying it was his first week on the job and he didn’t know how anything worked. Many organizations do have barriers meant to prevent these kinds of brazen impersonations, but they can often be circumvented fairly easily. When Hewlett-Packard hired private investigators to find out which HP board members were leaking info to the press in 2005, they were able to supply the PIs with the last four digits of their targets’ social security number — which AT&T’s tech support accepted as proof of ID before handing over detailed call logs. Act like you’re in charge.Most of us are primed to respect authority — or, as it turns out, to respect people whoactlike they have the authority to do what they’re doing. You can exploit varying degrees of knowledge of a company’s internal processes to convince people that you have the right to be places or see things that you shouldn’t, or that a communication coming from you is really coming from someone they respect. For instance, in 2015 finance employees at Ubiquiti Networks wired millions of dollars in company money to scam artists who were impersonating company executives, probably using a lookalike URL in their email address. On the lower tech side, investigators working for British tabloids in the late ’00s and early ’10s often found ways to get access to victims’ voicemail accounts by pretending to be other employees of the phone company via sheer bluffing; for instance, one PI convinced Vodafone to reset actress Sienna Miller’s voicemail PIN by calling and claiming to be “John from credit control.” Sometimes it’s external authorities whose demands we comply with without giving it much thought. Hillary Clinton campaign honcho John Podesta had his email hacked by Russian spies in 2016 when they sent him aphishing email disguised as a note from Googleasking him to reset his password. By taking action that he thought would secure his account, he actually gave his login credentials away. Phishing,as we noted above, which also includes text-basedsmishingand voice-basedvishingThese attacks are often low-effort but widely spread; for instance, a phisher might send out thousands of identical emails, hoping someone will be gullible enough to click on the attachment. Spear phishing,orwhaling,is a “high-touch” variation of phishing for high-value targets. Attackers spend time researching their victim, who’s usually a high-status person with a lot of money they can be separated from, in order to craft unique and personalized scam communications. Baitingis a key part of all forms of phishing and other scams as well—there’s always something to tempt the victim, whether a text with a promise of a free gift card or something much more lucrative or salacious. Pretextinginvolves creating a story, orpretext,to convince someone to give up valuable information or access to some system or account. A pretexter might manage to find some of your personally identifying information and use it to trick you—for instance, if they know what bank you use, they might call you up and claim to be a customer service rep who needs to know your account number to help with a late payment. Or they could use the information to imitate you—this was the technique used by thoseHP PIs we discussed above. Business email compromise(BEC),also known asCEO fraud,combines several of the above techniques. An attacker either gains control of a victim’s email address or manages to send emails thatlook like they’re from that address, then start sending emails to subordinates at work requesting the transfer of funds to accounts they control.

Atech support scamis a typical example of a quid pro quo attack. Tailgatingis an in-real-life form of social engineering in which an attacker tricks an employee into following them into the building, hence ‘tailgating.’ This is achieved, for example by pretending to be a delivery person or pretending to be an employee who forgot their badge and takes advantage of the human desire to be helpful and nice. The security company Norton has done a pretty good job of outliningsome red flags that could be a sign of a social engineering attack. These apply across social and technological techniques, and are good to keep in the back of your mind as you try to stay on guard: Someone you know sends an unusual message:Stealing or mimicking someone’s online identity and then mining their social circles is relatively easy for a determined attacker, so if you get a message from a friend, relative, or coworker that seems off, be very sure you’re really talking to them before you act on it. It’s possible that your granddaughter really is on a vacation she didn’t tell you about and needs money, or that your boss really does wants you to wire a six-figure sum to a new supplier in Belarus, but that’s something for you to triple-check before you hit send. A stranger is making an offer that’s too good to be true:Again, we all laugh at the Nigerian prince emails, but many of us still fall for scams that trick us by telling us we’re about to get something we never expected and never asked for. Whether it’s an email telling you won a lottery you didn’t enter or a text from a weird number offering you a free gift card just for paying your phone bill on time, if it feels too good to be true, it probably is. Your emotions are heightened and you have to act now:Social engineering scammers play on strong emotions—fear, greed, empathy—to inculcate a sense of urgency specifically so youdon’tstop to think twice about scenarios like the ones we just outlined. A particularly pernicious technique in this realm is a tech support scam, which preys on people who are already nervous about hacks but not very tech savvy: you hear from an aggressive person who claims to be from Google or Microsoft, tells you that your system has been compromised, and demands that you change your passwords right away—tricking you into revealing your credentials to them in the process. Fighting against all of these techniques requires vigilance and a zero-trust mindset. That can be difficult to inculcate in ordinary people; in the corporate world, security awareness training is the number one way to prevent employees from falling prey to high-stakes attacks. Employees should be aware that social engineering exists and be familiar with the most commonly used tactics. Some basic tips to avoid falling victim to social engineering attacks include: Resist the urge to click links in a suspicious email. Check the Web address of a link (by placing your mouse cursor over the link) and the sender’s email address before visiting the destination website. Visit websites directly rather than clicking links in emails. Be cautious of email attachments, even if it looks like it’s from a familiar sender. Check for signs such as poor quality of the logo or email, poor grammar or misspellings. Fortunately, social engineering awareness lends itself to storytelling. And stories are much easier to understand and much more interesting than explanations of technical flaws. Quizzes and attention-grabbing or humorous posters are also effective reminders about not assuming everyone is who they say they are. But it isn’t just the average employee who needs to be aware of social engineering. As we saw, social engineers focus on high-value targets like CEOs and CFOs. Senior leadership often resists going to the trainings mandated for their employees, but they need to be aware of these attacks more than anyone. CSO contributor Dan Lohrmann offers the following advice: Train and train again when it comes to security awareness.Ensure that you have a comprehensive security awareness training program in place that is regularly updated to address both the general phishing threats and the new targeted cyberthreats. Remember, this is not just about clicking on links. Provide a detailed briefing “roadshow” on the latest online fraud techniques to key staff.Yes, include senior executives, but don’t forget anyone who has authority to make wire transfers or other financial transactions. Remember that many of the true stories involving fraud occur with lower-level staff who get fooled into believing an executive is asking them to conduct an urgent action — usually bypassing normal procedures and/or controls. Review existing processes, procedures, and separation of duties for financial transfers and other important transactions.Add extra controls, if needed. Remember that separation of duties and other protections may be compromised at some point by insider threats, so risk reviews may need to be reanalyzed given the increased threats. Consider new policies related to “out of band” transactions or urgent executive requests.An email from the CEO’s Gmail account should automatically raise a red flag to staff, but they need to understand the latest techniques being deployed by the dark side. You need authorized emergency procedures that are well-understood by all. Review, refine and test your incident management and phishing reporting systems.Run a tabletop exercise with management and with key personnel on a regular basis. Test controls and reverse-engineer potential areas of vulnerability. 50% Business email compromise (BEC) attacks comprise50%of all social engineering (source: Verizon’sDBIRfor 2023). $50 billion $50 billion was lost to BEC attacks between October 2013 and December 2022 (source:FBI) 39% Smishing comprises39%of mobile threats (source:SlashNext) 45% Social engineering attacks increased45%in 2023, coincident with the launch of ChatGPT (source:SlashNext) 17% At 17% of all intrusions,phishing is the second most common initial infection vector for malware(source: Mandiant’sM-Trends 2024report.) A number of vendors offer tools or services to help conduct social engineering exercises, and/or to build employee awareness via means such as posters and newsletters. Also worth checking out is social-engineer.org’sSocial Engineering Toolkit, which is a free download. The toolkit helps automate penetration testing via social engineering, includingspear phishingattacks, creation of legitimate-looking websites, USB drive-based attacks, and more. Another good resource isThe Social Engineering Framework. Currently, the best defense against social engineering attacks is user education and layers of technological defenses to better detect and respond to attacks. Detection of key words in emails or phone calls can be used to weed out potential attacks, but even those technologies will probably be ineffective in stopping skilled social engineers.

Low-tech tactics still top the IT security risk chart,https://www.csoonline.com/article/2098369/low-tech-tactics-still-top-the-risk-chart-for-organizations.html,"USB-based attacks, QR codes for phishing and social engineering continue to be some of the most effective, now more dangerous with the help of AI. USB-driven attacks on the rise QR codes ripe for exploiting Supercharging social engineering with AI Related content Critical remote code execution flaw patched in Veeam backup servers Signal threatens to leave France if encryption backdoor required CIOs and CISOs take on NIS2: Key challenges, security opportunities Microsoft pushes a lot of products on users, but here’s one cybersecurity can embrace Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Low-tech attack vectors are being adapted by cyber criminals to overcome security defenses because they can often evade detection until it’s too late. USB-based attacks, QR codes in phishing emails, and social engineering, improved with the help of generative AI, are examples of relatively low-tech tactics being used to launch significant attacks. This has been confirmed in the latestVerizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), which found tried-and-true attack tactics continue to be successful, underscoring the fact that organizations must remain vigilant against well-worn methods, even as the threats posed by generative AI shake things up. USB-based attacks, in which a physical USB drive is loaded with malicious payloads to infiltrate a company’s systems and networks upon connection, have garnered renewed interest of late. The attack vector most frequently relies on social engineering to get corporate end-users to plug infected drives into their company desktops and laptops. In recent years, bad actors have created fake company-branded drives, sent devices as part of fake promotions impersonating retail brands, and even resorted to sendingtoys like teddy bears with inbuilt USB drivesas fake prizes or loyalty gifts. Nation-state threat actors are also deploying USB-loaded infections to attack infrastructure,CheckPointnoted earlier this year. The Raspberry Robin worm, a common malware variant, is ripe for this kind of attack and has been used in successful infections. AsMandiantnoted last year, malware-loaded USB attacks continue to be a useful vector to gain initial access into organizations. “With such a focus on new technologies like generative AI, or high-profile threats like state-affiliated advanced persistent threats, it’s easy to lose sight of the basics,” says Nick Hyatt, director of threat intelligence at Blackpoint Cyber. Hyatt’s team recently identified a rogue USB drive used to install the Raspberry Robin malware, which acts as a launchpad for subsequent attacks and gives bad actors the ability to fulfil the three key elements of a successful attack — establish a presence, maintain access and enable lateral movement. “Because it has a loader capability, it can be set to download a cobalt strike beacon to establish that persistence that enables attackers to get initial access and start building that into an environment,” Hyatt tells CSO. In other domains, he sees threats with malvertising, or malicious ads, that can be widely deployed. A browser not using an ad blocker leaves users vulnerable to clicking on what look like ads or sponsored banners but are actually malicious and can deliver malware to their devices. The challenge with these kinds of attacks is trying to identify the malicious activity in the exploitation phase when it’s happening. “Post-exploit, there are far more opportunities to identify malicious activity,” he says. Hyatt sees a risk of organizations placing too much focus on new and innovative attacks and overlooking less sophisticated methods. “By focusing on security hygiene rather than chasing the latest fad, they can be better positioned to prevent low-tech attacks that are often more effective.” QR code-based attacks is one area that needs more attention because they seek to exploit the human element that isn’t necessarily trained to be wary of them, according to Deral Heiland, principal security researcher IoT at Rapid7. Re-emerging with Covid-19, they’re now commonly used in many settings such as freight, accessing Wi-Fi details, authenticating online accounts and transferring payment information and are ripe for exploitation. Attacks via QR code phishing, also called quishing, are on the rise according toindustry reports, with scammers sending well-constructed phishing emails or installing malicious QR codes in public leading people to click on them thinking it should be secure. Even commonplace tasks such as generating aQR code to configure the Microsoft Authenticator appthat’s used for two-factor authentication with Office 365 is open to exploitation, because it normalizes QR codes as a secure mechanism in the minds of users, Heiland says. “People have been trained not to click on links, but not when it comes to using QR codes for authentication,” Helland tells CSO. The danger with a QR code is that it can be configured to launch almost any application on a device, download a file, or open a browser and go to a website, all without the user being aware of what it’s going to do. They also often move people to mobile devices, which don’t usually have the same protections as other devices, thereby enabling bad actors to deploy malicious QR codes and steal sensitive data. This can pave the way for all sorts of attacks, yet they don’t tend to set off the same alarm bells as email links. “By themselves, the patching processes or the security environment may be less important because it’s still possible to trick people with QR codes, even if they’re well trained not to click on links in emails,” says Heiland. What’s even more worrying for security leaders is the prevalence of QR code attacks aimed at the C-suite, with executives 42 times more likely to be on the receiving end of a malicious quishing attack, according to data from Abnormal’s latest email threat report.“We need to train people with QR codes not to click on anything, check the links and other text for misspelt words and use the phone settings to prevent it launching apps, a browser or anything,” Heiland adds. Human error continues to be a major component of incidents and comes up again and again in incident analysis reports. It’s one reason low-tech, low-barrier attacks remain a persistent danger — they target the human element, which can’t just be managed with technical controls alone. It explains why social engineering-based fake help desk phone calls have been identified in major incidents including the GoDaddy and MGM Resorts breaches. It shows that with a bit of creativity and some generative AI tools, cyber criminals can overcome protections like two-factor authentication and encourage sharing credentials and changing passwords that open the way in for attackers. In the MGM attack, which has come witha hefty $100-million price tag, a well-researched phone call to the help desk enabled the attackers to gain access by tricking someone into resetting a user’s multifactor authentication. The attackers used stolen usernames and passwords aided by supporting information collected from a high-value user’s LinkedIn profile and were able to steal customer information and disrupt many of its business operations. “Cyber criminals can get quite far with very little technical know-how and we need to continue raising awareness about the low sophistication classic attacks that continue to work,” says Maria-Kristina Hayden, CEO and founder of Outfoxm, who specializes in cyber hygiene. Whether it’s ‘classic’ social engineering such as walking into a building to gain physical access to a network, mailing a letter impersonating a charity fundraiser, making phone calls about fake issues or digital social engineering, the ability to manipulate someone into providing information or access is still a viable one. Hayden says criminals are now going further and targeting people at home in a bid to use personal information to gain access to corporate accounts and networks. Typically reserved for targeting executives and those in leadership positions with access to sensitive business information, this threat is as criminals look to strengthen their social engineering tactics and scripts to counter employee education campaigns. “Generally, all the boats are rising in terms of security awareness across organizations and most people are becoming more skeptical in the workplace, but at home, they’re less skeptical and less on guard,” she tells CSO. Criminals are taking advantage of this and targeting Gmail and Facebook accounts with the hopes of ultimately gaining access to organizations, she says. As the MGM example showed, social media sites including Facebook and LinkedIn are a treasure trove of personal information. What makes these sites so valuable is the ability for criminals to establish links from one person to another, helping them build a rich picture of family, friends, interests and workplace that can be harvested for well-constructedsocial media attacks. It’s not just executives who are in their sights. There are a whole range of roles cybercriminals are going after, such as software developers, HR staff, technology support staff, payments and finance, executive assistants, and client-facing staff because they have access to networks and systems attractive to cyber criminals. “It’s not just people at senior levels or in critical positions, we should also be providing those employees with resources to better protect themselves and help raise awareness,” she says. Cyber criminals are also harnessing generative AI tools that can improve the language, style and design of social engineering and phishing campaigns and, as a result, they’re becoming more realistic and harder for people to identify. By polishing their approach with better links, improving spelling and grammar, and incorporating other tactics like QR codes, these attacks draw far fewer red flags to people and systems trained to look out for classic tell-tale signs. “These social engineering tactics continue to be successful because attackers are persistent and getting creative with the help of AI, so they’re more persuasive than ever,” Hayden says.

How this hacker group steals payment card data Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Spear phishingis a direct, targeted email attack aimed at specific individuals that appears to come from a trusted sender. In spear phishing, attackers often use information gleaned from research to put the recipient at ease. The ultimate aim is to either infect devices withmalwareby convincing the recipient to click a link or download an attachment, or to trick the recipient into taking some other action that will benefit the attacker, usually handing over information or money. Spear phishing messages are crafted with care usingsocial engineeringtechniques and are difficult to defend against with technical means alone. And they’re ruthlessly efficient. Although Spear phishing emails make up less than 0.1% of all emails sent, or five emails a day for a typical organization, they are responsible for 66% of all breaches, according to Barracuda’s2023 Spear-Phishing Trendsreport. By contrast, regular phishing emails comprise 16% of all emails sent, but are responsible for just one-third of breaches. “What’s important to note about spear phishing is that the individual being spear phished isn’t often the real target,” J.R. Cunningham, CSO at Nuspire, a Michigan based MSSP. “Rather, their corporate environment is most likely the attacker’s ultimate end goal.” Phishing, spear phishing, andwhalingare all types of email attacks, withphishingbeing a broader category of cyberattack that encompasses just about any use of email or other electronic messaging to trick people, and spear phishing and whaling being just two of a handful of differenttypes of phishing attacks. Most phishing attacks take the form of generic messages sent automatically to thousands of recipients. They’re written to be somewhat tempting—the attachment might have a name like “salary report,” or the link might be a fake lottery winning site—but no attempt is made to match the message content to any particular person who might be receiving it. The name derives from “fishing” (with the “ph” being part of the tradition of whimsical hacker spelling), and the analogy is of an angler throwing out a baited hook (the phishing email) and hoping some victim will swim along and bite. Spear phishing, as the name implies, involves attempting to catch aspecificfish. A spear phishing email includes information specific to the recipient to convince them to take the action the attacker wants them to take. This starts with the recipient’s name and may include information about their job or personal life that the attackers can glean from various sources. Whalingis a kind of spear phishing, specifically one that goes after really big fish—think CEOs, board members, celebrities, politicians, etc. Spear phishing attacks don’t just happen out of the blue. Here’s a look at the discrete steps in a typical spear phishing attack.  Infiltration.Like most attacks, spear phishing often starts with compromising an email or messaging system through other means—via ordinary phishing, for instance, or through a vulnerability in the email infrastructure. Once inside the system, an attacker can move to the next step: reconnaissance. Reconnaissance.How attackers get the personal information they need in order to craft their email is a critical spear phishing technique, as the entire process of the attack depends on the messages being believable to the recipient. Having gained access to the system, the attacker “sits in the network for a while to monitor and track interesting conversations,” explains Ori Arbel, CTO of CYREBRO, a Tel Aviv-based security operations platform provider. “When the time is right, they email the target using a believable context with insider information, such as bringing up past conversations or referencing specific amounts for a previous money transfer.” If they can’t hack their way into the communications system, an attacker could also turn toopen source intelligence (OSINT), scouring social media or corporate communications to form a picture of their target. Exploitation.In this stage, attackers use the information they’ve gathered to launch a targeted attack. Since the email is coming from a legitimate (albeit compromised) account, the emails appear totally legitimate, and the reconnaissance allows the attacker to perfect mimic the senders’ signature and text style. Jorge Rey, cybersecurity and compliance principal at Kaufman Rossin, a Miami-based advisory firm, explains a common attack vector he’s seen. “When people make a change to their LinkedIn and identify that they’ve joined Kaufman Rossin, in a matter of hours or even minutes they’ll get an email from our CEO—not from his Kaufman Rossin email, but something at gmail.com—asking them to buy gift cards and things like that.” Of course, this email isn’t coming from the CEO at all, but rather an attacker who’s hoping to catch a new employee off guard. “All of these bots are monitoring LinkedIn, monitoring everything through scripts, and sending information hoping someone will fall for it,” he explains. If attackers can glean personal information from your online presence, they’ll try to use that to their advantage as well. Nuspire’s Cunningham gives an example of a security-savvy client who nevertheless almost got snared by spear phishing. “They got an email supposedly from their insurance company informing them they had an update on their auto insurance claim and clicked on the link, only to realize right away it was a phishing attack,” he says. “As it turns out, this individual had recently been in a car accident and had published pictures of the wreck on social media, along with a comment that their insurance provider (whom they named) was very quick to respond to the claim. This gave the attacker information about the victim’s insurance provider, which was used to craft the spear phish.” Cybersecurity company Proofpoint outlines an expandedset of stages, but the important thing to take away is that these are complex, highly targeted, multi-stage attacks, and like all cyberattacks they are constantly evolving. 0.1% Spear phishing emails make up less than 0.1% of all emails sent but they causetwo-thirdsof all breachesSource:Barracuda Spear phishing can be especially hard to detect because the messages are so tailored to you and your organization—assuming the attackers have done the work to make the email sufficiently believable. But here are a couple of key things to look out for: It will ask you to do something unusual or outside corporate channels.After all, that’s the only way to part you from your (or your company’s) money. New employees might have a hard time realizing requests are out of the ordinary, but to the extent that you can, you should listen to your gut. It conveys urgency.Yes, in a professional environment we often get legitimate requests to act quickly; but when someone tries to make you rush, that’s a sign they’re not giving you a chance to stop and think. This example was shared with KnowBe4’s Roger Grimes, a former CSO columnist. It was sent to the recipient by name and appeared to come from his email service provider. It has been modified to remove vendor names, graphics, and links, but clearly shows how skillful attackers have become at crafting their messages for maximum impact. Dear Valued Customer, We are pleased to announce the go-live date for a new Data Center, scheduled to go live on April 19, 2010. Please update your firewall rules to allow SMTP traffic on port 25 from the following IP address ranges:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx – xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)xx.xxx.xxx.xx/xx (xx.xxx.xxx.xx – xx.xxx.xxx.xxx) If you have settings on your e-mail server which control the IPs which are allowed to connect for e-mail relay please confirm that those settings are updated as well. We will be able to test and verify connections one week prior to April 19, 2010. Additionally, we will be proactively running connection tests prior to the launch on behalf of all customers, and contacting you directly if we are unable to connect to any of your domains from ALL specified IP addresses for that domain. Prior to the launch of the new IP addresses, we recommend that you set up and configure the Deferral Notification alerting feature for your domains using the Deferral Notification option on the Domain properties page in the Admin Center. The Deferral Notification alert feature sends a message to you when a customized threshold has been met or exceeded for deferred e-mail in your domain. After the new IP addresses are launched, this feature will help to ensure that e-mail sent to your domains is not deferred because of unsuccessful connection attempts to your network, and that you alerted in the event that e-mail is being deferred beyond your acceptable limits. For more information on how to set up the Deferral Notification alert feature, see the Admin Center Guide in the Resource Center. Please refer to the Configuration subtab of the Administration Center for a complete list of IPs which should be allowed to connect to your environment at any time. See more onhow fraudsters hone their spear phishing attacks. In its2023 Spear-Phishing Trendsreport, Barracuda breaks down spear phishing attacks into 5 main types, listed here in order of prevalence: Scamming(47%) – As the name implies, scamming attacks use deceptive tactics to trick victims, often into divulging sensitive information or paying money. A recent VISA report found that 15% of US adults have beentargeted by inheritance scams, which appeared to come from legitimate sources. Brand impersonation(42%) –Brand impersonation attacks, also calledwebsite spoofing, trick users into thinking they are interacting with known, trusted brands—like social media sites, banks, and well-known tech brands. BEC(8%) –Business email compromise (BEC) attacks, also known asCEO fraud, is when a phishing email is crafted to look like it’s coming from a CEO or other high-profile person in an organization, someone with authority. An oft-cited example is an email appearing to come from the CEO or CFO sending an urgent request to wire money. Extortion(3%) – An extortion attack is one that relies on threats to intimidate victims into taking a desired action. This includes something like sextortion, where victims are threatened with the release of compromising photos or videos, but it could also be someone purporting to be an IRS agent who threatens arrest if overdue taxes aren’t paid. Conversation hijacking(0.3%) – Often used in conjunction with account takeovers, a conversation hijacking attack uses compromised emails to launch attacks. The attacker inserts themselves into a conversation thread, often between coworkers, and then uses the typical phishing tactics to get the victim to download an attachment or click a link. There are some technical measures that can help stop spear phishing attacks, like turning ontwo-factor authentication, protecting your email infrastructure withDMARC, SPF, and DKIM, and usinganti-phishing tools and services. But the best defense against social engineering attacks like spear phishing is human intelligence, and that requires training that keeps users on their toes. “A phishing simulation makes a big difference,” says Kaufman Rossin’s Rey. “It’s one thing to go to a PowerPoint and show you a phishing email. It’s another thing to get something in the mail, you click on it, andthenyou’re being sent to the to the training. We’ve seen that people do get better at recognizing attacks, because people hate the sensation of clicking on a link and getting a message that says, ‘You’ve been phished.’ It’s much more powerful than a yearly compliance training.” As we hope this article has made clear, it’s better to be embarrassed as part of an unannounced simulation that to fall prey to the real thing. Be skeptical. Ask yourself: Who is this email from? If the sender is purporting to be your CEO, pay particularly close attention to the request being made, the language being used, and any other signs that the send isn’t who they claim to be. Don’t click on attachments. If you open the email and are prompted to download images or attachments, be especially wary. Malware is often delivered by email attachments. The best policy here is to only open attachments that you were expecting to receive or are able to verify with the sender. Ignore requests for action. If the email isurging you to do something, stop and think before you act. Messages telling you to claim a prize are an old, effective trick. The old adage, “if it’s too good to be true, it probably is,” applies here. Spear phishers also play into our desire to be helpful. If your CEO doesn’t normally ask you to wire money, it’s unlikely that they’ll start doing so in a random email message. But sometimes the actions are more innocuous. It could be IT telling you your computer is infected and they need to take control of your machine, for example. The best thing you can do is independently verify any request for action. Don’t click links.Almost all phishing emails either have an attachment they want you to download or a link they want you to click. The easiest way to find out if a link is legit is to hover your mouse over the link to reveal the url. If you don’t recognize the url, don’t click. And, if the link shows as an IP address (example :192.168.1.1), that is most likely not a place that you want to go. Use the phone.When in doubt, go straight to the source. Look up the phone number yourself (don’t use one provided in the email.) If the request is legitimate and truly urgent, the CEO will answer your call. If not, well, you just saved your company a huge headache. Read more on spear phishing: 4 steps to prevent spear phishingYour users are in the crosshairs of the best attackers out there.

Years ago, when this speciality in offensive security was taking off, there was a large shift away from manual techniques to relying on a variety of tools. Most of these were open source. Then pentesting itself divided up into several niches for everything from network to web app to social engineering to cloud. As a pentester, identifying the top tools used across all niches was quite difficult as each pentester will have a dedicated set of tools applying to that particular platform. Pentesting involves, depending on the methodology, about nine phases including (but not limited to) reconnaissance, fingerprinting, gaining and maintaining access, defense evasion, covering tracks, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration. Each with their own dedicated tools. Before diving into the tools, remember to pentest responsibly. Just because a target exists, doesn’t mean we can test it. These tools aren’t just cool toys for tech geeks; they’re legitimate weapons in their capabilities. If you’re anxious to fire these up and test drive them for yourself, make sure you’re doing it in a lab you control or against places like theDamn Vulnerable Web Application(DVWA) orHackazon. These are created to be vulnerable on purpose so you can test your ability to find known weaknesses and exploit them. Several enterprise-strength and automated tools have emerged recently but those require licenses and have a heftier price tag. I picked the 10 open-source tools below based on widest usage and recognition. This honorable mention is the heavyweight champ of the wireless pentesting world.Aircrack-ngis also a suite of tools and functions and focuses on areas of Wi-Fi security like monitoring, launching stealthy attacks, rigorously testing defenses, and cracking those tough WPA keys like a master locksmith. The primary use of Aircrack-ng is to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks, particularly targeting WEP and WPA/WPA2-PSK security protocols. It works by capturing network packets and then applying various algorithms to decipher the keys used to secure wireless networks. It also includes Airmon-ng to put your wireless card into monitor mode, Airodump-ng for packet capturing, and Aireplay-ng to generate traffic and induce conditions favorable for network analysis and attacks. This tool is widely used by network administrators for security assessments and by cybersecurity professionals and ethical hackers to test the strength and resilience of wireless networks against unauthorized access and other security threats. Think ofSQLmapas the savvy old-timer in the pentesting game, not just surviving but thriving in a landscape filled with ever-evolving threats. It automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerabilities in web applications. SQLmap works by sending various types of requests to the target web application and analyzing the responses to identify potential vulnerabilities. Once it finds a SQL injection flaw, SQLmap can be used to extract data from the database, gain administrative access to the database, or even execute remote commands on the server. It supports a wide range of databases and includes numerous features for advanced manipulation and customization of SQL injection attacks, making it a highly effective tool for assessing the security of web applications that interact with databases. Sure, it might have a few years under its belt, but make no mistake, it’s still a big player on the pentesting field. Why, you ask? Because believe it or not, SQL injection (SQLi) still haunts the digital world in 2024, and this is one of those rare tools that tackle the SQLi challenge head-on, without needing you to dive into the deep end manually. Welcome to the secret weapon of the web app pentesting world.ZAP, previously known as OWASP ZAP, might not have the household name status, but in the circles of web application warriors, it’s akin to what Nessus is in network security. It’s an open-source web application security scanner designed to help automatically find security vulnerabilities in web applications while you are developing and testing them. The tool functions as an intercepting proxy, sitting between your browser and the web application so it can inspect and manipulate the traffic going to and from the site. This allows ZAP to identify issues such as broken access control, insecure configurations, and other vulnerabilities. Its rise in popularity comes from being both user-friendly and effective for both those new to application security as well as professional developers. Additionally, ZAP provides a range of tools and features, including automated scanners, a set of tools for manual testing, and various add-ons for extended functionality, making it a comprehensive solution for web application security testing. Wiresharkgets a basic reputation for just doing “packet sniffing” but it’s a tool so versatile and powerful that it almost feels like cheating. Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer widely used for network troubleshooting, analysis, development, and education. It captures and displays the data traveling back and forth on a network in real-time, making it possible to examine detailed information about network protocols, packet data, and network traffic. Wireshark allows users to see the granular details of network activities at both the micro and macro levels. It’s used to diagnose network problems, inspect network security issues, debug protocol implementations, learn network protocol internals, and even evaluate firewalls rules. With its powerful filtering and search capabilities, Wireshark enables users to isolate and analyze specific packets of interest from a network traffic stream. This makes it an indispensable tool for network administrators, security professionals, and anyone who needs to understand the flow of data on a network. Sure, it might play second fiddle in my toolkit, given my focus on cloud and web app pentesting, but when it comes to the art of network pivot, Wireshark is in a league of its own. Now,John the Rippermight not be my everyday tool in the pentesting toolbox, but let’s face it – no pentesting tool roundup is complete without a nod to the classic art of password cracking. Most experienced pentesters have learned to rely on robust tables they’ve custom built over time for dictionary and rainbow table attacks, but sans that- John the Ripper will most often get the job done. A powerful tool for password cracking, it’s widely used to test password strength and can be used to crack various types of passwords. It’s particularly effective in testing the resilience of passwords in a network environment. If you’re on teamHashcat, you’re not wrong either. Certain certification tests ask which is the “best” password cracking tool and list both of these but it really comes down to preference. Kind of like Vim versus Nano. Step aside for the titan of vulnerability scanners,Nessusis the one tool that’s become almost synonymous with the very concept of uncovering network weak spots. In my experience, this is probably the most downloaded, utilized, and recognized vulnerability scanner of all time. Nessus is used to scan for network vulnerabilities, configuration issues, insufficient benchmarks, and missing patches, among other issues. It’s the kind of tool that doesn’t just work on the surface; it digs deeper, offering insights and findings that are as valuable as they are comprehensive. Once systems have been fingerprinted, we want to identify which types of exploits that system may be vulnerable to and this gives us a great place to start. After this step is when MEtasploit and other exploitation tools step in to finish the job. Now we’re getting to the crown jewel in my pentesting toolkit, especially when it comes to the world of web application security,BURP Suiteis indispensable for anyone serious about diving deep into the intricacies of web app pentesting. Sure, it might not boast the same download numbers as Nessus, but BURP Suite is the sturdy steed that’s got the back of web application security researchers. It’s a complete package, an integrated platform that’s all about versatility and depth. From scanning and spidering to attacking and exploiting, BURP can intercept, manipulate, it can URL-encode payloads, change delivery methods, and it can send requests right to a website. As a bonus they have one of the most respected free training academies available in all the ways their tool can be leveraged in a myriad of situations and objectives. Claiming a well-deserved spot in my top three is offensive distributions, specialized operating systems for pentesting. These often work as a one-stop shop that includes as many tools as possible in one download for every phase of pentesting — from recon and OSINT all the way to exfiltration. It even includes fringe functions like forensics, reverse engineering, and simple security auditing tools. For a long timeKali Linuxwas the only name in this space because it neatly categorizes tools to align with the various phases of a penetration test. You can literally go to the start menu > pick phase: OSINT/Exploit/Data Exfil/Forensics > select tool > and launch. But Kali isn’t the only sheriff in town anymore. Take, for instance,Parrot OS, which is gaining notoriety against Kali especially with institutions like EC-Council endorsing it for their CEH certification modules and exams. Parrot OS is carving out its niche, appealing to a broader audience with its user-friendly interface and a lightweight environment that doubles down on performance and security. Parrot runs leaner and doesn’t have so much overload. It’s important to note that this shift isn’t about one being better than the other; it’s about choice and the right fit for different styles and preferences in the pentesting community. In this red teamer’s opinion you should find the tools that work for you and snapshot them into an image of your own distro. While it may no longer be the sole monarch of the exploitation kingdom, thanks to emerging challengers like Atomic Red Team,Metasploitcontinues to command respect and high regard in the pentesting arena. A tool with a formidable force in the exploit and post-exploit phases – a true friend, especially for those just cutting their teeth in the world of pentesting. What we continue to love about Metasploit is that it isn’t just a tool; it’s the entire go-to toolkit for developing, testing, and executing exploit code against remote targets. Metasploit isn’t just about finding vulnerabilities; it’s about testing them, executing on them, and understanding how they can be exploited in real-world scenarios. Even if you’re a Cobalt Strike convert, you’ll more than likely have started with this first, because it’s free and user-friendly. Topping my list at the No. 1 spot isNmap. It’s the undisputed champion in the reconnaissance and fingerprinting arena, a critical stage in any pentesting operation. This tool isn’t just a part of the pentester’s toolkit; it’s the starting point of nearly every security adventure. Nmap is this incredible blend of a powerful network discovery tool and a meticulous security auditor. It will uncover every little secret from open ports and running services to system versions and missing patches. It’s no wonder that it’s equally revered by both network and system administrators for its versatility and depth. What truly sets Nmap apart is its astounding customizability. You can tailor its scans to be as broad or as pinpointed as you need. I rarely go for the kitchen sink (the all-encompassing open scan) because honestly, it’s like opening a firehose of data. Instead, I opt for the surgical approach, targeting specific aspects like filtered ports or OS versions, and Nmap handles it like a pro. For us pentesters, Nmap is our first foray into actively engaging with a system after the passive recon dance, and it’s usually a stealthy one at that. Chances are, no intrusion detection system is going to flag you while Nmap does its thing.

How this hacker group steals payment card data DOJ indicts North Korean conspirators for remote IT work scheme Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  For decades, the financial sector and other industries have relied on an authentication mechanism dubbed “know your customer” (KYC), a process that confirms a person’s identity when opening account and then periodically confirming that identity overtime. KYC typically involves a potential customer providing a variety of documents to prove that they are who they claim to be, although it could also be applied to authenticating other people such as employees. With the ability of generative artificial intelligence (AI) that use large language models (LLMs) to create highly persuasive document replicas, many security executives are rethinking how KYC should look in agenerative AI world. Consider someone walking into a bank in Florida to open an account. The prospective customer says that they just moved from Utah and that they are a citizen of Portugal. They present a Utah driver’s license, a bill from two Utah utility companies, and a Portuguese passport. The problem goes beyond the probability that the bank staffer does not know what a Utah driver’s license or Portuguese passport looks like. The AI-generated replicas are going to look exactly like the real thing. The only way to authenticate is to either connect to databases from Utah and Portugal (or make a phone call) to not only verify that these documents exist in the official systems but that the image in the official systems matches the photo on the documents being examined. An even bigger security threat is the ability of generative AI create bogus documents quickly and on a massive scale. Cyber thieves love scale and efficiency. “This is what is coming: Unlimited fake account setup attempts and account recovery attempts,” says Kevin Alan Tussy, CEO at FaceTec, a vendor of 3D face liveness and matching software. Lee Mallon, the chief technology officer at AI vendor Humanity.run, sees an LLM cybersecurity threat that goes way beyond quickly making false documents. He worries that thieves could use LLMs to create deep back stories for their frauds in case someone at a bank or government level reviews social media posts and websites to see if a person truly exists. “Could social media platforms be getting seeded right now with AI-generated life histories and images, laying the groundwork for elaborate KYC frauds years down the line? A fraudster could feasibly build a ‘credible’ online history, complete with realistic photos and life events, to bypass traditional KYC checks. The data, though artificially generated, would seem perfectly plausible to anyone conducting a cursory social media background check,” Mallon says. “This isn’t a scheme that requires a quick payoff. By slowly drip-feeding artificial data onto social media platforms over a period of years, a fraudster could create a persona that withstands even the most thorough scrutiny. By the time they decide to use this fabricated identity for financial gains, tracking the origins of the fraud becomes an immensely complex task.” Alexandre Cagnoni, an independent identity consultant, agrees that the KYC security threats from LLMs are frightening. “I do believe that KYC techniques will need to incorporate more sophisticated identity verification processes that will for certain require AI-based validations, using deepfake detection systems. The same way MFA and then transaction signing became a requirement for financial institutions in the 2000s because of the new MitB attacks, now they will have to deal with the growth of those fake identities,” he says. “It’s going to be a challenge because there are not a lot of (good) deepfake detection technologies around and it will have to be quite good to avoid time-consuming tasks, false positives or the creation of more friction and frustration for users.” Cagnoni says that decent detection tools for catching deepfake videos are available, but even the best ones still struggle. He references recent testing where systems that identified fake videos as fake also identified valid videos as likely fake. Rex Booth, CISO at identity management firm SailPoint Technologies, differs from others in that he sees the KYC LLM problem as serious but not immediately critical. “I don’t think the KYC script needs to be completely rewritten, but it does need to be built upon, strengthened, and augmented. We do not fully use the potential of some of the authentication measures that we have available today,” he says. “Granted, the tools that we have today are insufficient, but they are nonetheless the tools that we have.” A handful of current authentication mechanisms–including biometrics with liveness testing and behavioral analytics with as many datapoints as possible–are often mentioned as possible ways to combat LLM-generated identity fraud, but most are strong at verifying whether an existing customer is indeed the one making a request. They are much less effective for onboarding because there is often no data about a new potential customer. Behavioral analytics, for example, only work if a history of that user’s behaviors is available for comparison. Biometrics only work with a highly reliable indication of what that person truly looks like. Some behavioral analytics can operate standalone and do not necessarily always have to leverage the history of that customer, says Linda Miller, CEO of the Audient Group, a Washington DC-based consulting firm. “Are they typing in their Social Security number as though they are copying it rather than typing it from memory? Have you checked the applicant’s name against a database of recent data-breach victims?” she says. “You are not going to solve this problem with a tool. The KYC strategy has to be multi-layered, and it has to be risk-based.” One possible way to do that would be to have far more identity details shared among financial entities. Cagnoni argues that companies are hesitant about sharing such details, however. Beyond competitive issues, there is the poorly defined area of global compliance and whether such data-sharing would violate any regional compliance rule. “Consider the privacy regulations here in Europe. Could I share any behavioral information? They would have to share some identifying information to communicate,” Cagnoni says. “What if I have a limp in my right leg? Could sharing that violate any type of regulations? Most of the banks don’t want to share this information about customers. I don’t see banks sharing behavioral information.” Booth, however, doubts compliance implications of sharing such authentication data among companies would be a problem because just about all the impacted compliance rules focus on personally identifiabledata. “Behavioral analytics in terms of how I move my mouse is an individual-level authentication. That is not data.” As for trying to access government databases to verify identities or documents, Miller says she is highly skeptical. “Government and data are two words that go horribly together. Government agencies are using very old data through really antiquated systems. Some 25 states today are still on Cobol.” Another problem Cagnoni flags is fake employees. That is where a thief identifies companies that allow fully remote work. “How are individuals vetted? In situations where you wouldn’t have to turn up at the office, you could be maintaining 100 jobs. We don’t currently have a silver bullet for this.” That scheme would take advantage of how a lot of enterprises function. The first X weeks would be paperwork and training and other tasks that don’t necessarily produce much that is tangible. Cagnoni suggests that an effective thief could receive money from payroll for many weeks–potentially months–before being discovered, assuming they are ever discovered. Part of the problem that authentication experts stressed is that many business models today do not meaningfully allow for the time, effort, and investment to do extensive identify verifications. “The authentication systems we have today are a reflection of the incentives we put in place. The incentives right now are to encourage workers to move fast and reduce friction and accept a certain amount of fraud,” Booth says. “As it stands right now, the incentives don’t work for meaningful identity verification.” Miller agrees with Booth that the structure that businesses use for bonuses and other incentives discourage workers from trying to identify fraudulent behaviors. “There is a human element to it. Businesses put in place perverse incentives when it comes to a diligent KYC process,” she says, adding that management doesn’t want to slow down processes “when people are waiting to close a transaction with a customer.” Instead, Miller, who had been a principal at Grant Thornton, the audit and assurance firm, suggests that CISOs identify their top financial issues “and tailor your KYC to those highest risk areas. But remember that in almost every arena, generative AI will accelerate fraud. Social engineering and phishing are about to become an order of magnitude more effective [because of generative AI].” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS Critical vulnerability in AMI MegaRAC BMC allows server takeover Password managers under increasing threat as infostealers triple and adapt What is Magecart?

Here’s how cyber teams can cope The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time Almost 1 million business and home PCs compromised after users visited illegal streaming sites: Microsoft Linux, macOS users infected with malware posing as legitimate Go packages Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  In a year full of national elections, security pundits and practitioners arefocused on the shape of influence campaigns in 2024. Withmore than a third of the world’s population heading to the ballot boxin more than50 elections worldwide, the threat of disinformation powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and shaped by a tense international arena feels more significant than in years past. In the West, government officials havevoiced concernsabout the political process involving controversial candidates and issues, where the impact of novel attacks such as compromise of polling systems or use of deepfakes to suggest vote tampering might amplify insecurity. Recent research by this author and his colleagues in theJournal of Cybersecurityoffers a fresh take on one kind of digital threat to democracy that is often overlooked or mislabeled — that ofcyber-enabled influence operations(CEIO). Conversation about the information threat to democracies in 2024 often centers oncyber influence operationsorelection hacking. These discussions often conflate two separate kinds of interference and compromise. Influence operations involve attempts to degrade, corrupt, or subvert the national information environment for gain. Cyber operations involve disruption, espionage, and subversion of information infrastructure. Our research engages the idea that CEIO exist, but we often don’t clearly see what they might mean for our democracy because we tend to overfocus on acts that are more one thing than the other. In particular, we clarify the character of CEIO by studying the footprint of foreign-backed malign information operations. Attacks on voting infrastructure or high-profile compromise of politically relevant systems are often less effective at aiding influence campaigns than they sound. Instead, malware deployed to enhance the spread of social network connectivity and disinformation presents as a critical feature of sophisticated influence operations. It can overcome constraints faced by foreign malign actors and amplify attempts to reach broad sections of Western population. How do cyberattacks aid attempts to generate influence? Many expertsarguethat they really don’t. The logic of each activity for political purposes is quite different. Cyber operations, while occasionally used to degrade national security capabilities, typicallyfollow the format of intelligence operationsin that they emphasize access, compromise of systems, and secrecy to achieve strategically valuable goals (e.g., IP theft or performative sabotage). Influence operations manipulate and corrupt information conditions to achieve persuasive effects (e.g., for political deception or distraction). While there are similarities, the operational shape of cyber and influence operations ends up being quite distinct. Both need secrecy for success, for instance. With influence operations, however,secrecy matters much more after an attackis launched due to the need to sustain effects. The opposite is generally true for cyber activities. Likewise, while cyber operations subvert systems by making them act in ways not intended, the mechanisms of doing so are syntactic or rely on narrow social engineering attacks. Access, in other words, is possible via manipulation of tangible systems. Influence operations also seek to subvert but “compromise” and “access” are psychological outcomes, at least above the level of campaign tactics. You can hack a social media account, but actual influence requires shaping the information environment via less direct methods of sociopolitical messaging. This is made harder by the attacker’s need to avoid revealing themselves and risk the credibility of an influence operation’s messaging, which is not always true for cyber activities. For the past decade, experts have pointed to ways in which cyber and influence operations can sometimes enhance one another. These fall into four categories: Preparatory operationsare activities that leverage the intelligence potential of cyberattacks to enhance the potential of a subsequent influence campaign. Those actions include reconnaissance, resource (e.g., botnets) creation, account takeover, directed capacity denial, and targeted sociopolitical compromise. Manipulative attacksare intended to create influence in themselves (e.g., by compromising voter systems). Attacks in parallelinvolve cyber activities leveraged against a nation simultaneously with influence activities without clear operational coordination. Influence-enabling attacksreverse the conventional logic of CEIO and see interference activities leveraged to augment the sociopolitical impact of cyber operations. Until recently, research on cyber and influence operations deployed in tandem has mostly focused on manipulative and parallel attacks. There are several reasons for this. Influence-enabling activities focused on the psychological impact of cyber operations come with many operational complications and are likely to be rare. Evidence about preparatory attacks is much more difficult to come by in the public arena than more visible operations against national infrastructure or political targets. Until recently, national security practitioners believed that preparatory cyber actions are never what makes influence operations strategically relevant and so are less worthy of focus. Direct manipulative attacks or attacks in parallel to influence operations activities, by contrast, aligns with the warfighting mentality that has driven more than two decades of thinking on cyber operations as tools of statecraft: Visible attempts to interfere in foreign states might have clear signaling value. The utility for spreading malign influence is unclear, and this is the issue with a focus on CEIO that emphasizes cyberattacks conducted in visible formats. Attacks against election infrastructure may have minimal effects on citizens’ trust in election integrity, but they add little value to more subtle attempts to shape public attitude. This prompts a question as to whether manipulative attacks are distinct from operations conducted in parallel. If they present as a separate form of influence activity, then they are not truly an exercise in influence enabled by cyber. While cyber threats to political processes have had minimal impact on the decision-making of political elites, they aren’t as clear signals as attacks on military targets or other kinds of critical infrastructure. Our recent researchbreaks new ground in understanding how cyber operations, particularly the use of malware, can expand the scope of influence campaigns. Using sophisticated model techniques, my colleagues and I examined the content of Russia’sInternet Research Agency’s (IRA) influence campaign on Facebookduring the Russian Federation’s 2014-2016 interference campaign in the United States in an attempt to answer a simple question: What drove the IRA’s targeting? The results were remarkable, illustrating a threat lifecycle driven by the outsider-looking-in dynamic of malicious influence operations and involving the novel use of malware to further the spread of malign influence. As many researchers have noted, there are clear trends in the content the IRA deployed on Twitter, Facebook, and elsewhere in thecampaign to interfere with the US 2016 presidential campaign season. These include a focus on African American communities and race issues alongside discourse on police brutality, Second Amendment issues, and more conventional content (e.g., video game and sports conversation). Why these topics? What drove variation in how content was posted over time? Explanations for the IRA’s targeting efforts include that the Russians were working from the content of the one-time intelligence leakorchestrated by Paul Manafortor were just focused on the most divisive issues of the day. We began with an alternative idea rooted in the logic of influence operations: The need to avoid attribution means that influence operators must use organic developments in their target nation as a foundation for finding an audience. Using AI techniques, we found that Facebook ad content was published in a particular order. Regardless of whether the focus was Black Lives Matter (BLM) or pro-law enforcement issues, we saw scaremongering content published in one period and then replaced by messaging encouraging users to take action. Not only does this parallel conventional political messaging, this pattern of appealing to fear first and then action second appeared and reappeared directly in line with domestic triggering events. After both incidents of and rallies against police violence, for instance, the messaging cycle would begin anew. This confirms that sophisticated malign influence activities rely on developments in a target nation to generate initial interest without compromising the identity of the attacker. Perhaps most interestingly, our research also unexpectedly uncovered evidence of malware being leveraged against Facebook users. While it may seem counterintuitive that the IRA would hack users that they are trying to influence without being caught, the operational approach here was clear. They used click-fraud malware likeFaceMusicto infect an initially gullible population, enhance the visibility of troll farm content used by IRA accounts, and then expand the reach of the influence operation to more diverse social media populations. Given the focus in CEIO research on direct attacks on influence infrastructure like voting systems or social media platforms, this finding is revelatory. This research shows a clear lifecycle of CEIO activities that is rooted in a robust understanding of the constraints facing influence operators. We might think of this as a capture chain rather than the traditional kill chain. As the diagram below shows, preparatory cyber activity is critical in the development of influence campaigns that can be the differentiator between tactical results and strategic value. After a belligerent like the IRA establishes its initial social media footprint, it engages in a messaging campaign that references domestic triggering events to engage and capture an initial population. As with much social engineering, however, the first-mover principle with influence operations is to target gullible persons to expand access. Malware was the key to this goal, translating the prospects of the operation from one with limited likelihood of serious impact to something capable of generating strategically meaningful manipulation of America’s information environment. Christopher Whyte This new take on the use of malware for influence operations not only refocuses research and practice on CEIO, it also helps make sense of high-level empirical patterns in the marriage of cyber and influence efforts in the past couple of years. As Microsoft and other technology stakeholders have noted recently, for instance, there is a clear difference in practice between Chinese and Russian and Iranian threat actors in this space since 2020. While Chinese APTs have beenlinked to numerous influence campaigns, the use of malware or more performative cyber actions alongside such efforts is minimal, particularly against Western targets. By contrast, hackers backed by Moscow and Tehran consistently blend the methods, to questionable results. A promising explanation for this divergence lies in the character of Chinese influence operations, which have often focused on the West more on issue-based manipulation of media and less on subverting sociopolitical systems. Such an approach relies much more on distraction and on generating noise than it does on targeted audience effects. As such, the utility of malware is less. How should security teams assess risk around cyber-enabled influence? The conventional answer to this question is similar to assessing risk from geopolitical crisis. When considering the threat of manipulative or parallel cyber activities, vulnerability is most significant for two types of actors. First, any organization whose operation directly ties into the function of electoral processes is at heightened risk, whether that be social technology companies or firms contracted to service voting infrastructure. Second, organizations that symbolize key social or political issues are at risk of compromise as foreign threat actors seek to leverage contemporary conditions to produce performative ends. This new research, however, suggests that risk lies much more problematically with workforces than with organizations themselves. The use of malware against vulnerable populations on social media suggests that the CEIO threat is much more disaggregated than national security planners and industry security teams would like. Traditional hygiene controls like workforce training and constraints on the use of personal equipment are obviously key to limiting organizational vulnerability to infection. More generally, however, the notion of a capture chain emphasizes yet again the need for sociopolitical intelligence products to be factored into security analytics. Assessing CEIO risk means not only understanding how geopolitical circumstance heightens company vulnerability, it means understanding when personnel background and practice introduces new risk for organizational function.

It’s also a best practice for cyber insurance vendors and meeting compliance requirements. A popular evaluation test, thetabletop exercise, permits security teams and corporate management to select a threat and then run through the process of containing and remediating the threat. In a tabletop exercise, a team discusses their roles and responses during an emergency under different scenarios, typically with someone acting as a facilitator. It’s not a full-scale drill but an opportunity for stakeholders to talk through a simulated crisis. Which ones should you choose to test? There are as many tabletop exercises as there are potential vulnerabilities. Experts recommend that tabletop exercises be run throughout the year and rotated based on a company’s risk profile. Some threats, however, tend to be on everyone’s list of risks. These are four of the most common threats for which security teams should run tabletop exercises: No one is safe from ransomware attacks as they are among the most rewarding for cybercriminals, who often target indiscriminately. Beyond the initial ransom demand, attackers might attempt to extort both the victim and their business partners, as well as customers of the company targeted in the original attack. A study from 2021 by Cybereason noted that 80% of companies that pay a ransomware demand are frequently hit a second time by the same attackers, sometimes with the same attack and sometimes with a follow-on extortion attempt. A 2023 study from Akamai said a ransomware victim is six times more likely to face a follow-up attack within three months. Despite the lull in 2022 ransomware attacks, due in part to the Russia and Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic, ransomware claims were up 50% in 2023 over 2022, notes David Anderson, vice president of cyber liability at Woodruff Sawyer, a national cyber insurance brokerage. This year is expected to have more ransomware attacks than 2023, he says. During an enterprise’s tabletop evaluation of its defenses against cyberattacks, the team will be looking for ways to identify and mitigate the ransomware and any subsequent extortion attacks. Because of regulatory reporting requirements and potential legal and financial liabilities, stakeholders from outside the security function should participate. This might include legal, communications, finance, compliance, and marketing. Here are some questions that should be asked to further protect customers and business partners from the initial attack. Is all customer data encrypted to ensure that even if the data is stolen, it will be of no use to the attacker? Is the customer data on a separate subnet or otherwise segregated from primary corporate data? How is business partner data protected to ensure that when a breach occurs, the business partner’s confidential data cannot be used against them for extortion purposes? What strategies are in place to defend against artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ransomware attacks? How well did the existing ransomware plan work during the exercise? How well does the ransomware plan, as exercised, ensure the continuity of the company’s systems? What can be improved? What methods can you use to contain the attack? What are your contingency plans in case your current backups are compromised? How far back must you go to find a non-compromised backup? How often do you test your backups to see if they are recoverable and not compromised with malware? What is the process for reporting a ransomware attack to meet regulatory compliance? How does security coordinate with legal, marketing, and communications teams to inform affected parties and the media? According to theVerizon 2022 Data Breach Investigations Report,62%of all data breaches happen viathird–partyvendors. Forrester Senior Research Analyst Alla Valentesaid last yearthat the survey likely undercounted the third-party threat, with perhaps more than 70% of breaches including some third-party component. Third-party risk management (TPRM) exercise participants should include representatives from key downstream business partners — partners who supply goods and services to the enterprise — as well as your cyber insurance provider, law enforcement, and all key stakeholders, often including the board of directors and senior management. While supply-chain attacks are ubiquitous, often they are misidentified because the actual attack might be initially identified as ransomware, an advanced persistent threat, or some other cyber threat. Often it requires the forensics team post-breach investigation to identify that the attack came through a trusted third party. Here are some recommended questions to include. How well do you vet your business partners’ communications and data transfers for potential threats? Do your business partners have direct access to the enterprise’s databases or does the data first go through a screening for potential threats? Do you have any operations with partners that bypass existing security controls or policies that would create potential vulnerabilities for malware to pass from a partner to the enterprise? What policies and procedures do you have in place to ensure the secondary and tertiary partners downstream are providing uncompromised data that eventually will enter your network or cloud? Do you test downstream supply-chain partners or only your primary partners? Many enterprises are third-party suppliers to companies upstream, in that they use data and services supplied by the company doing the tabletop exercise. How do you test data leaving your corporate network or cloud to ensure no malware is infecting upstream partners? What policies and procedures are in place to ensure that any data existing in the corporate network or cloud are analyzed for malware before being transferred to a business partner? What policies and procedures are in place to vet a potential business partner and who has the authority to overrule the results of the vetting process? If vulnerabilities with a third party are identified, what are the procedures to remediate the issue before the partner is given access to corporate assets? Have you tested all of your cloud instances to ensure that they are properly configured and secured? Have you tested all corporate email addresses to ensure that none belong to former or deceased employees or unused service accounts and that all email addresses are appropriately secured? There are cases where corporate code bases were compromised when data was downloaded from what were considered reliable code repositories that had been infected by malware. The RepoJacking attack on GitHub, for example, led to millions of repositories being potentially compromised. Following are some questions Aqua Securityrecommendsbe answered concerning GitHub, although they would be appropriate for any repository breach: What are all the GitHub organization names you used before? Were there any mergers and acquisitions your organization was involved in? Are there any dependencies in my code that lead to a GitHub repository vulnerable to RepoJacking? Is there guidance somewhere (documentation, guides, Stack Overflow answer, and the like) that suggests you should use a GitHub repository vulnerable to RepoJacking? Insider threats come in two primary types: malicious insiders who deliberately compromise corporate assets for personal, financial, political or some other gain, and those who create a security vulnerability either accidentally or simply due to lack of knowledge but without malice. In the former case, a deliberate crime against the company is committed. The latter case might involve either a user error or perhaps a user taking an action that seems reasonable to them to perform their jobs but could create a vulnerability. However, there might or might not be a crime committed. Here are some questions to ask during this tabletop exercise scenario that can help shed light on whether an insider threat is deliberate or not. What security controls are in place when specific requests are made to transfer corporate funds, regardless of whether the request is made through email, a phone call, or a video call? How often are these controls reevaluated and updated by security and management teams due to changing technical capabilities? What physical security controls are in place to ensure only an authorized user has access to on-premises computing assets? What security controls are in place for remote users to access any assets, including their own email and data storage? What tools do you have in place to identify an insider threat? Are these tools able to classify the potential threat as malicious or non-malicious? What are the organization’s policies and procedures for handling insider threats? What are the legal and regulatory implications of insider threat incidents? What steps can be taken to mitigate the risk of an insider threat? The goal of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks is simply to shut down operations. The 2023 attack on Google, which peaked at nearly 400 million requests per second, demonstrated the staggering potential enterprises face in defending against today’s botnet armies. Because DDoS attacks are virtually always from outside the network, enterprises preparing a tabletop exercise targeting DDoS protections need to ask questions about continencies, early identification and network resiliency.  Here are some examples. How quickly can a DDoS attack be identified and segregated? What plans are in place to mitigate an attack, particularly at the network’s edge? What defenses are in place at the infrastructure layer to defend against synchronized (SYN) floods and other reflection attacks? What defenses are in place at the application layer for HTTP request floods and similar application-based attacks? What is being done to reduce the attack surface area to reduce the number of attack vectors? How is the network being scaled to respond to potential abnormal attacks? How is your endpoint detection and response configured to defend against DDoS attacks? How often do you test it? While each tabletop exercise is unique and will include questions specific to the enterprise’s goals, those posed here can aid security teams in sorting out their priorities. Generally, the first step of the tabletop exercise is identifying the goal, which then will reflect on the questions ultimately posed.

"The state of ransomware: Faster, smarter, and meaner",https://www.csoonline.com/article/2069830/the-state-of-ransomware.html,"The ransomware business hit record highs in 2023 despite falling payment rates, as attackers scaled up the number of attacks and new AI weapons were brought to bear on both sides of the war, promising to make an even bigger impact this year. Phishing remains the top way into an organization AI-backed phishing Rise of “triple extortion” Faster vulnerability exploits Rust, intermittent encryption, and more Be ready for more ransomware as a service Related content Report on ransomware attacks on Fortinet firewalls also reveals possible defenses The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time The state of ransomware: Fragmented but still potent despite takedowns Ransomware goes postal: US healthcare firms receive fake extortion letters Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Ransomware payments hit $1.1 billion in 2023, a record high and twice what they were in 2022. The frequency, scope and volume of attacks were all up, as was the number of independent groups conducting the attacks, according to areport by Chainalysis. “We’re tracking dozens more groups than we used to,” Chris Morgan, senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at ReliaQuest, tells CSO. “And a lot of these groups are taking experience from one operation and starting their own operation in the back of it, often in the wake of law enforcement activity.” With more business activities taking place online, there are more potential victims for ransomware, Morgan says. Plus, there are some countries where law enforcement has limited jurisdiction, a vacuum of opportunity for groups to emerge. The size of each individual payment is also up, with more than three quarters of all payments totaling $1 million or more — up from just over half in 2021. The only bright spot last year was that more victims refused to pay ransoms and restored from backups, instead. According toCoveware, only 29% of victims paid up in the fourth quarter of 2023, a record low — and down from 85% in 2019. Similarly, cyber insurance claimsdata from Corvus Insurance, shows that only 27% of victims pay ransoms. Phishing remains a top attack vector for ransomware. “There are a number of ways that ransomware groups facilitate the initial access and social engineering is the one we see the most of,” says ReliaQuest’s Morgan. “It’s overwhelmingly phishing and spear phishing.” According to theIBM X-Force threat intelligence reportreleased in February, phishing emails were the initial access vector in 30% of all ransomware attacks. Compromised accounts tied for first place, also at 30%, followed closely by application exploits at 29%. Despite all the phishing simulations and security awareness training, users don’t seem to be getting better at spotting phishing emails. According toFortra’s global phishing benchmark report, also released in February, 10.4% of users click on a phishing email, up from 7% a year ago. And, of those who click, 60% give up their passwords to the malicious site. “I just don’t think that training programs work,” says Brian Spanswick, CISO and head of IT at Cohesity. “We do phishing simulations every quarter, but my percentages stay the same — and there’s no pattern about who did and didn’t click. Now with AI making social engineering attacks so much cleverer, my confidence is even lower.” Even though users are trained in cybersecurity and warned that there will be a phishing simulation happening, 17% still click, Spanswick says. “We’ve been at it for a couple of years, and it seems pretty constant, right around there. And at my previous company, it was the same. And the industry standard is the same.” The solution is to put controls in place to keep those emails from getting through in the first place, and to limit their impact when they do. For example, not letting people have administrative privileges on their laptops, not letting them download video games or attach a storage device, and making sure the environments are segmented. The increasing sophistication of social engineering attacks is a particular concern. Spanswick says he’s seen a clear increase in AI-generated phishing attempts. Or, at least, likely to be AI. “They may have hired better English majors and read a bunch of press releases from the CEO to get a sense of the tone he uses,” he says. “But it’s significantly more likely that they’re using generative AI.” According to IBM X-Force, a human-crafted phishing email takes an average of 16 hours to create. By comparison, AI can generate a deceptive phish in five minutes. There was a time when phishing emails were relatively easy to spot, says Elliott Franklin, CISO at Fortitude Re, a company that provides insurance to other insurance companies. “It used to be that you’d just look for the misspelled words.” Now, the bad guys are using AI to create these messages — and the improvements go far beyond having perfect grammar. “They’re using AI to check LinkedIn and know to the second when someone changes jobs,” Franklin says. “Then they send them an email welcoming them, from the CEO of that company.” They’re sending pitch-perfect emails asking employees to re-authenticate their multi-factor authentication, he says. Or asking them to sign fake documents. With generative AI, the emails can look absolutely real. Plus, when you add in all those compromised accounts, then the return email address could be completely real, as well. “Most of our users get a couple of hundred emails a day,” Franklin says. “So, you can’t blame them for clicking on those links.” And AI doesn’t just let attackers perfectly mimic an executive’s writing style. This January, adeep-faked CFO on a video conference callconvinced a finance worker in Hong Kong to send a $25 million wire. There were several other staffers on the call — staffers the finance worker recognized — who were all AI fakes as well. That worries Franklin because today, when a Fortitude Re employee wants a password reset, they need to do a video call and hold up their ID. “That’s going to work for a while,” says Franklin. But eventually the technology will be easy and scalable enough that any hacker can do it. “Ultimately, that’s what we will have,” he says. Fortitude Re is tackling the problem on several fronts. First, there are business risk mitigation processes. “We can’t slow our business partners down but we absolutely have to have a written and enforced policy. Say, here, you’ve got to call this person, at this number, and get approval from them — and you can’t just send an email or text. Or you have to go to our company document management system — not an email, not a text, not a direct message on WhatsApp,” said Franklin. Employees are starting to realize that this is important and worth the effort. Then there’s the basic blocking and tackling of cybersecurity. “That’s the old stuff that people don’t want to talk about anymore. Patching. Identity and access management. Vulnerability management. Security awareness.” It may be old stuff, but if it was easy to do, he wouldn’t have his job, Franklin says. And it all must be done within the budget and with the people he has. Finally, to deal with the latest evolution in ransomware, Franklin’s fighting fire with fire. If the bad guys are using AI, so can the good guys. In the past the company used Mimecast to defend against phishing emails. But in mid-2023, Fortitude Re switched to a new platform that used generative AI to detect the fakes and help protect the company against ransomware. “Email is the primary source of ransomware attacks, so you have to have a good, solid, email security tool that has AI built in.” The old-school approach is to look at specific indicators, like bad IP addresses and specific keywords. That’s not enough anymore. “The bad guys have copies of the email security solutions and they can tell what’s blocked and what isn’t,” Franklin says. That means that they can get around traditional filtering. Today, an email security tool must be able to read the entire message and understand the context surrounding it — like the fact that the employee who is supposedly sending it is on vacation, or that the email is trying to get a user to take an urgent, unusual action. Ironscales automatically filters out the worst emails, puts warning labels on others that have suspicious content, and uses generative AI to understand the meaning of the words, even if specific keywords aren’t there. Mimecast, along with Proofpoint, have long been the gold standard for email security, says Franklin. “They owned the market, and I was a huge Proofpoint fan and implemented it at a lot of companies. But I don’t think they’re really innovating right now.” Another example of a trick the bad guys are using is to include a QR code in the phishing email. Most traditional security tools won’t catch it. They just see it as another harmless embedded image. Ironscales can spot QR codes and see if they’re malicious, which was the feature that “really sold us on the program,” Franklin says. Greg Pastor, director of information security at Remedi SeniorCare, a pharmacy services provider, expects ransomware attacks to continue to increase this year. “We have to fight AI with AI,” Pastor tells CSO. Instead of traditional signature-based antivirus, he uses AI-powered security tools to prevent ransomware attacks, tools likemanaged detection and responseandendpoint detection and response. In addition, the company uses browser isolation tools from Menlo Security and email security from Mimecast. But, just in case anything still gets through, there’s a plan. “We have a comprehensive incident response program where we simulate a ransomware attack. We’re definitely posturing up for AI attacks,” Pastor says. “The attackers will be integrating AI into their ransomware-as-a-service tools. They’d be stupid not to. You’re not going to make any money as a cybercriminal if you’re not keeping up with the Joneses. It’s a continuous cycle — on the company side, the vendor side, and the cyber criminals.” Another company that uses AI to defend against ransomware is document storage company Spectra Logic. It now has tools from Arctic Wolf and Sophos that automatically detect suspicious behaviors, according to Tony Mendoza, the company’s vice president of IT. “We try to keep ourselves ahead of the game,” he says. And he has to. “Now I’m seeing way more AI-based attacks. The threat actors are leveraging AI tools that are available to everyone.” In 2020, when the company’s teams first went remote during the pandemic, the company was hit by a social engineering attack. Someone opened an email they shouldn’t have and attackers obtained access. The attack propagated quickly through the company’s network. Infrastructure was 99% on-prem, he says. “Interconnected. Not segregated. All of our systems were live, transactional systems, incredibly fast — they could propagate a virus in a flash.” They even compromised the backups and the software used to make the backups. “They wanted $3.6 million in three days,” says Mendoza. “It’s the most stressful situation I’ve ever had in my career.” Luckily, the company also had snapshots, air-gapped and secure from attack, of both data and systems. “So, we immediately cut off communications with them.” Now, Mendoza says, he’s more proactive. “I understand it will happen again. No security is 100%, especially with AI-based attacks.” Since then, Spectra Logic has invested in security infrastructure, network segmentation, full encryption, anomaly detection that can automatically quarantine devices, an incident response framework, and cyberattack recovery plan. Previously, it only had a recovery plan for a physical disaster. And anomalies show up a lot, he says — thousands of times a day. “In the past, we’d have to look at it and make a human decision, maybe cut a person off the network if they’re suddenly connecting from North Korea.” But with the volume of incoming threats being so high, only AI can respond quickly enough. “You have to have an automated tool in place.” There were false positives in the beginning, he says, but, like AI does, the systems learned. According to the NCCThreat Monitor report for 2023, notable trends included the rise of “triple extortion” attacks. Attackers will encrypt data and hold it hostage. But, as more and more victims simply restore from ransomware, they are also exfiltrating the data and threatening to release it publicly. Closing the triple effect, attackers will also notify regulators about the attacks, and the victims directly to put additional pressure on organizations to pay up. And it gets even worse. A criminal group known as Hunters International breached Seattle’s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in late 2023, and when the center refused to pay a ransom, the attackers threatened to “swat” cancer patients. They also emailed patients directly to extort additional money from them. “Hunters International are really trying to apply the pressure,” says Josh Smith, security analyst at Nuspire, a cybersecurity firm. “They’re doubling down on their extortion tactics. The fact that they’ve escalated to this point is very alarming.” In 2024, other ransomware groups may follow suit if these tactics prove successful. “I do unfortunately believe that we’ll see more of this,” Smith says. Attackers also doubled down on exploiting new vulnerabilities in 2023. Both the phishing and the vulnerability-based attack strategies are likely to remain popular in 2024, Smith says. “They like the lowest-hanging fruit, the least amount of effort. While phishing is still working, while vulnerabilities are still working, they’ll keep doing it.” In fact, when cybersecurity firm Black Kite analyzed the experience of 4,000 victims, exploiting vulnerabilities was the number one attack vector. “They have automated tools for mass exploitation,” says Ferhat Dikbiyik, Black Kite’s head of research. “Last year they got into Boeing and other big companies.” Take, for example, the MoveIt attacks. This was a cyberattack that exploited a flaw in Progress Software’s MoveIt managed file transfer product. Ransomware group Cl0p began exploiting the zero-day vulnerability in May, getting access to MoveIt’s customers. The attacks were devastating, says Dikbiyik. “We identified 600 companies that were open to this vulnerability that were discoverable by open-source tools — and the attackers attacked all of them.” According toEmsisoft, as of February 2024, the total number of organizations impacted by this vulnerability was over 2,700 and the total number of individuals was more than 90 million. In January,Black Kite released a new metric, the ransomware susceptibility index, which uses machine learning to predict a company’s exposure to ransomware based on data collected from open source intelligence as well as public-facing vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and open ports. “Of all the companies that have an index of .8 to 1, 46% experienced a successful ransomware attack last year,” Dikbiyiksays. “That shows that if you are waving flags to pirate ships in the oceans, you will get hit. The best way to battle these guys is to be a ghost ship.” There is some positive news about zero days. According to IBM X-Force report, there was a 72% drop in zero days in 2023 compared to 2022, with only 172 new zero days. And, in 2022, there had been a 44% drop compared to 2021. However, the total number of cumulative vulnerabilities passed 260,000 last year, with 84,000 of them having weaponized exploits available. Since many organizations still lag in patching, however, vulnerabilities continue to be a major attack vector. According to IBM, exploits in public-facing applications were the initial access vector in 29% of all cyberattacks last year, up from 26% in 2022. The pace of innovation on the part of ransomware criminal groups has hit a new high. “In the past two years, we have witnessed a hockey stick curve in the rate of evolution in the complexity, speed, sophistication, and aggressiveness of these crimes,” says John Anthony Smith, CSO and founder of cybersecurity firm Conversant Group. And the breaches that took place in 2023 demonstrate these threats. “They have combined innovative tactics with complex methods to compromise the enterprise, take it to its knees, and leave it little room to negotiate,” Smith says. One sign of this is that dwell time — the length of time before the first entry to data exfiltration, encryption, backup destruction, or ransom demand — has dramatically shortened. “While it used to take weeks, threat actors are now often completing attacks in as little as four to 48 hours,” says Smith. Another new tactic is that attackers are evading multifactor authentication by using SIM swapping attacks and token capture or taking advantage of MFA fatigue on the part of employees. Once a user authenticates themselves, tokens are used to authenticate further requests so that they don’t have to keep going through the authentication. Tokens can be stolen with man-in-the-middle attacks. Attackers can also steal session cookies from browsers to accomplish something similar. A SIM swapping attack allows ransomware gangs to get text messages and phone calls intended for the victim. The use of personal devices to access corporate systems has only increased these security risks, Smith adds. According to Shawn Loveland, COO at Resecurity, ransomware attackers continued their use of vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, using botnets, and “living off the land” by using legitimate software and operating system features during an attack. But there were also some new technical aspects of attacks last year, he says. For example, ransomware developers are now increasingly using Rust as their primary programming language because of its security features and difficulty in being reverse engineered. “This is a significant development in the field,” Loveland says. There is also a new trend towards intermittent encryption, which only encrypts parts of files. “This makes detection more challenging, but the encryption process faster.” Every cybersecurity expert expects ransomware attacks to continue to grow as threat actors scale up their operations while enterprises continue to beef up their defenses. But one segment of the cybercriminal economy that might be in for a change is that of ransomware-as-a-service providers. The way these systems can work is that the provider creates the ransomware toolset, and individual affiliates send out the phishing emails and negotiate the ransoms. There’s a degree of isolation between the two groups to create resiliency and insulation from law enforcement. But authorities have recently indicated that they will be going after the affiliates. Plus, the affiliates themselves have turned out to be a security risk for the central ransomware provider. “With the takedown of LockBit, there’s going to be a lot of consideration by cybercriminals to be more hesitant about the affiliate-based system,” says Drew Schmitt, practice lead in the GRIT threat intelligence unit at GuidePoint Security. And sharing money with affiliates also cuts into the profits of the central ransomware group. “If they could use generative AI for negotiations, they could expand their efficiency,” Schmitt says. That would leave just the core group of ransomware operators and no affiliates, lowering total operational costs for the threat actors. “That’s something that we’re looking at.” If it does happen, it will probably take a few years before we see the full impact of this change. LockBit, the top ransomware operator in 2023, wastaken down by authorities in February. At the time of the takedown, the group had about 180 affiliates. There was hope that the takedown would put a dent in ransomware for 2024, butZscaler ThreatLabs were already observing new LockBit ransomware attacks, just a week after the takedown. And, according toBleepingComputer, LockBit has updated its decryptors, brought new servers on line, and is already recruiting new pentesters.

Cyber breach misinformation creates a haze of uncertainty,https://www.csoonline.com/article/2095897/cyber-breach-misinformation-creates-a-haze-of-uncertainty.html,"A string of recent false or misleading cyber breach reports, fueled by rampant online dissemination, is fostering an atmosphere of growing misinformation that makes it difficult to separate fact from fiction. False narratives about hacks have been increasing in recent months Pressure to get money fuels the false narratives The accelerating spread of misinformation online Companies also spread misinformation No easy solutions to the problem Related content Oracle Cloud breach may impact 140,000 enterprise customers DOGE’s cost-cutting database dives offer cybersecurity pros vital lessons in cloud security About 22k WAB customers impacted by a zero-day attack on a third-party vendor GitHub suffers a cascading supply chain attack compromising CI/CD secrets Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  As the landscape of cybercrime evolves, the challenge of navigating the fog of uncertainty is intensifying. The increasing frequency of false or misleading reports is creating a web of misinformation that sometimes makes discerning the truth about criminal cyber incidents virtually impossible. Over the past four months alone, the press, social media accounts, and some researchers have reported several high-profile incidents that turned out to be false or at least far different from what they initially seemed. In late January, a person claimed on a hacking forum to be selling the data for 48,606,700 Europcar.com customers. However, Europcarsaidthe data was fake and was fabricated using artificial intelligence. In late February, the ransomware group LockBit seemingly reemerged with new dark web sites after it wasdisrupted in an epic law enforcement takedown. A seemingly reconstituted LockBit gang threatened to release a trove of files it stole from Fulton County, Georgia in an attack earlier that month unless the county paid a ransom. The extortion effort proved a head fake when Fulton County called the gang’s bluff and no stolen files materialized. Also In late February, a little-known threat actor group called Mogilevich claimed it had hacked gaming giant Epic Games and stolen 189GB of data, which Epic Games denied. The audacity of this claim, made by a group that Brett Callow, threat analyst at Emsisoft, said is not likely a group but is “probably just one idiot,” was further highlighted when they also claimed to have hacked Ireland’s Department of Finance (DFA), which it denied. Faced with these denials, Mogilevich conceded its claims were not valid,sayingthey were “professional fraudsters” out to scam some quick cash. In early April, a threat actor called DoD offered on BreachForums three gigabytes of data allegedly stolen from the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) systems, claiming it was a contact list of critical infrastructure organizations worldwide. The EPAsaidthat DoD had confirmed it had never breached the agency and that the data posted was already publicly available. In mid-April, a new ransomware group called RansomHub added insult to injury by posting to its dark web site the sale of four terabytes of data it claimed had been stolen in a devastatingransomware attack on Change Healthcareby the once-disrupted but now-reincarnated AlphV/BlackCat group. At that point, Change Healthcare was reeling from the still-ongoing disaster the ransomware attack had on healthcare providers and pharmacies across the US, even though it was later revealed that Change Healthcare had paid the attackers $22 million to stanch the damage. Although cybersecurity experts believe, but are not sure, that RansomHub’s claims of having the data are real, confusion surrounds whether RansomHub is actually AlphV/BlackCat itself using an alias or an affiliate of that group or a brand-new group. What frequently makes grasping the facts surrounding breaches difficult are the tactics hackers use to pressure organizations into paying ransom quickly, often based on false or exaggerated claims. “Wow, it’s almost like we can’t trust criminals to give us a true answer,” Troy Hunt, founder of the data breach search website HaveIBeenPwned, tells CSO. “We’ve got to recognize that the folks we’re dealing with here are criminals, and their motives are clearly not pure. They’ll construct whatever narrative they need to service their own requirements.” “The gangs try to push organizations into paying quickly,” Callow tells CSO. “They do not want to wait until organizations have had time to do the forensics and find that they didn’t lose as much data as the gang claims or that the data wasn’t as sensitive as the gang claimed it was. It’s in their interests to try and force payments quickly, very often on the back of bluffs.” Callow thinks the misinformation problem, an enduring feature of cybercrime, accompanies greater turmoil in the threat actor world. “What is new is the increased rate of disruptions, creating a more unpredictable ecosystem,” he tells CSO. “Ransomware has always been unpredictable, but now it’s even more unpredictable.” Complicating the problem are acts of betrayal by ransomware gangs toward their affiliates due to the chaos spawned by law enforcement disruptions. In the case of RansomHub, for example, “Change Healthcare reportedly paid $22 million to AlphV, who was already in a somewhat dazed state from the law enforcement disruption and allegedly took off with the money not paying the affiliate,” Callow says. “The affiliate had the data and was attempting to extort United Health for a second time. Supposedly. It could also have been AlphV trying for a second round of extortion. A scam within a scam.” Fueling the rise of data breach misinformation is the speed at which fake data breach reports are spread online. In a recent blog post, Huntwrote: “There are a couple of Twitter accounts in particular that are taking incidents that appear across a combination of a popular clear web hacking forum and various dark web ransomware websites and ‘raising them to the surface,’ so to speak. Incidents that may have previously remained on the fringe are being regularly positioned in the spotlight where they have much greater visibility.” “It’s getting very difficult at the moment because not only are there more breaches than ever, but there’s just more stuff online than ever,” Hunt says. “It’s just a nonstop stream of all of these data breaches regularly numbering in the hundreds of thousands or millions of records, and that’s up there on the surface of the web for all to see.” Although Hunt says most reported incidents are what they appear to be, “it does mean that there’s just a huge amount of data floating around, and you’ve still got to do all the due diligence and verification on them.” Some press outlets contribute to the breach misinformation problem by uncritically reporting incidents posted on leak sites without much verification as they race to land scoops. “Any responsible journalist will be as cautious as they can be so as not to risk becoming, effectively, tools of the criminals,” Callow says. “It’s always a matter of balancing assisting the criminals against the public’s right to know. And some of these alleged incidents are very newsworthy.” Purported security researchers who continually produce reports of breach incidents can also be blamed for the misinformation. “I’ll put security researchers in quote marks there who try to build a following by tweeting details of each and every breach,” Callow says. “And they are very often assisting the criminals.” It’s not only cybercriminals contributing to the current tide of breach misinformation. Companies, long loth to go public with cyber incidents affecting their customers, often initially deny breaches, only to get dragged by journalists and others over time from denial to admission. AT&T, for example, recently started out denying a 2021 breach affecting 71 million of its customers, only tofinally confirmthat the breach affected 73 million customers. Hunt says, “As much as we say that there are breaches out there that are not breaches or misattributed, we’ve also got the problem where we’ve got organizations saying that there’s no breach, and then you give it time, and they’re like, oh no, okay, hang on. There is a breach.” “It’s not just threat actors misrepresenting things,” Hunt says. “It’s organizations not acknowledging that there is a breach when it has happened.” Few easy solutions to the misinformation problem exist aside from skeptically examining and conducting due diligence regarding the breaches claimed by threat actors. Hunt thinks the truth always lies in the data. “Until there is evidence to support a claim, it’s just a claim, and we remain skeptical. The truth is always there in the data. It’s just a question of analyzing it. I think for the press, particularly if you’re communicating with the threat actor involved in this, you can always put the question to them: can you prove this is legitimate? What are the indicators here that show that this is what you say?” And for companies that have experienced breaches or are the subject of false breach reports, sunlight is the best disinfectant. “We need to get everything out from in the shadows,” Callow says. “Far too much happens in the shadows. The more light can be shone on it, the better. That would be great in multiple ways. It’s not just a matter of removing some of the leverage threat actors have. It’s also giving the cybersecurity community and the government access to better data. Far too much goes unreported.” “I don’t think we are ever going to get to the point where things are clear and concise,” Hunt says. “For me, particularly running HaveIBeenPwned, all I want is the truth to come out of the data. If an organization has been breached, whether it’s breached or scraped, or whatever else, then let that truth come out. If they haven’t, then let that truth come out.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS Oracle Cloud breach may impact 140,000 enterprise customers DOGE’s cost-cutting

Batten down the hatches: it’s time to harden every facet of your Windows network,https://www.csoonline.com/article/1248963/batten-down-the-hatches-its-time-to-harden-every-facet-of-your-windows-network.html,"Gone are the days when a protected OS kept the bad guys out. Hardening authentication, the help desk, and log files in place is now needed to beat the bad guys. Help desk and administrators Policing third-party reporting Make sure all staff have at least MFA Web policies need to be hardened too Related content New phishing campaign uses scareware to steal Apple credentials Attackers probing backdoor flaw in popular Cisco Smart Licensing Utility, warns SANS New Windows zero-day feared abused in widespread espionage for years GitHub accounts targeted with fake security alerts Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Once upon a time, a Windows workstation could be hardened merely by running a series of scripts or a set of group policies. The security team could review guidance around security configurations from Microsoft, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), or the Center for Internet Security (CIS) and tick that box when the auditors came around. That was then — now, merely hardening the operating system is nowhere near enough to ensure that workstations won’t become an entry point for attackers. Vigilance must be extended to a wide array of locations that attackers consider your weak spots. Let’s look at some of the avenues through which attackers will exploit those weaknesses. Targeting help desk and IT administrators is a front-and-center tactic that attackers will use to convince users they see as weak links or easy targets in an organization. Identifying those on the help desk is easy: attackers prey upon the necessity to make access to IT support accessible and convenient. Many public organizations advertise quite widely how to reach support on their public websites or social media — searching LinkedIn will often reveal those key personnel in a company simply by job title. Once an attacker determines who’s on the help desk, they can send phishes to these individuals posing as an employee, which can be as easy as sending a phishing attack as a text message to a cellphone. Many firms and organizations such as hospitals, schools, and governments don’t have the ability to provide dedicated phones for two-factor authentication and must rely on staff members’ personal phones to allow access to their firm assets. With any business phone that has access to two-factor authentication applications, consider the use of security and management software that will vet the links and websites that are accessed from the device. Software such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can be deployed to phones to better protect both iPhone and Android users. If an employee refuses to install such software on their personal phones, always havealternatives available such as Yubikey hardware tokens. With a constant stream of zero-day vulnerabilities that impact both Android and iPhone, consider that these devices are no longer immune from security issues and must be monitored and managed as well. Consider guidelines for support incidents with your third-party vendors as well. A case in point isa recent Okta breachthat utilized an HTTP Archive (HAR) file, a JSON formatted file that represents your most recent network activity as recorded by your web browser. With so many applications on the web these days, vendors will often ask customers to create a HAR file in order to debug an access issue. These HAR files can and often do contain sensitive information and cookie files that can be used by attackers. The Network tab in Developer Tools of all browsers can be used to record an HTTP session. If you’ve never reviewed what a HAR file can contain, review by going to a website and performing the following: In Chrome, go to the webpage of a sensitive site. Developer Tools can be accessed via the menu (Menu > More Tools > Developer Tools). In that, select the Network tab from the newly opened panel. On the Network tab, make sure the round button in the upper left corner is in red. If it’s grey, double-click it to begin recording the interactions. Enable the preserve log to record all the web requests and responses. To export the HAR file, click the down arrow button in the network tab itself. Save the HAR file to your computer. (You can also use a program likehttpwatchto review the transaction in real-time.) Now open it up in a HAR analyzing program or even Notepad. You may observe that it contains information in regard to authentication tokens, cookies, session tokens, passwords, and API credentials. If a technical support team requests these files, ensure that your support staff knows that they often contain sensitive or proprietary information and it needs to be sanitized before sending the information to any third party for analysis. In an infamous hack earlier this year, the USState Departmentwas targeted by Chinese attackers who found code-signing certificates embedded in a memory dump that ended up in a public repository. The memory dump was from a Microsoft employee with access to sensitive levels of information. But attackers will also go after individuals in your organization who report to other levels. Once again, the use of social media and LinkedIn is a key way to investigate who is related to whom and to target individuals in the organization who may have a relationship with one another. Thus, ensuring that all staff have multifactor authentication and don’t just rely on a username and password to gain access to resources is key. Recently CISA has released a document onphishing guidancethat points out that mere antivirus is not enough. They go on to indicate that multifactor authentication is the primary mitigation for a tactic to obtain login credentials. Another common attack is malware phishing, in which the bad actor sends a malicious link to a target and tricks them into launching an attack. Mitigations for this type of attack include application-allow listings, and running an endpoint detection and response agent. But don’t just have this sort of protection on workstations, consider these protections on phones and devices as well. Consider additional protection such as DNS tools that pre-scan the websites and links that your users are going to. These tools do not have to break the bank and can even be obtained at low cost or no cost to your organization. Ensure that even those who work from home set up their home routers to point to such DNS filtering tools as OpenDNS and instruct users on how to set up categories that they wish to block. If you want to go even farther in ensuring that your firm is protected, you can consider web policies that will block users from all websites unless they have a business need to the organization. I’ve seen this done successfully in school environments where the staff and children in the school are younger and have no need for full access to the internet. Restricting sites may seem draconian for some firms, but if you can, consider flipping any deny policies you may have in place to an “only if allowed” mindset instead. Finally, review the logging that all of your applications and third-party interactions have and their retention duration — often, it’s only upon review that you determine how the attacker gained access. Microsoft was urged by CISA and others to expand and make more logging a default procedure after the attacks on the State Department earlier this year. They had initially promised to roll out the much-neededMailitemsaccessedlogging to all tenants by October of this year. Now, however, buried in aroadmaplinked from aMicrosoft blog, this promised tool to identify what an attacker has accessed won’t come out until September of next year. Bottom line, don’t just harden the operating system these days, harden your authentication, harden your help desk, and harden those log files that you keep. You’ll need all of these hardenings in place to beat the bad guys.

In Ukraine,early digital Russian actionsin support of the invasion struck not just government targets, but also satellite operators, media firms, and manufacturing companies. Over nearly two years, thecyber dimensions of the warhave involved dozens of civilian and state-backed hacking entities and an attack surface constituted of all areas of civil society on both sides. With the Israel-Hamas conflict,dozens of pro-Hamas and pro-Iranian threat actorshave attacked targets as diverse as news agencies, commercial retailers, and social media companies. This trend of pulling private-sector entities and civil society organizations into crises is likely to continue. In any conflict over Taiwan, in the Korean Peninsula, or linked to Iranian interests elsewhere in the Middle East, for instance, the scope of engagement would undoubtedly include private-sector aggression as a means of exerting pressure beyond direct diplomacy or military dispute. Awareness of the rising risks of being drawn into geopolitical quagmires is not enough for cybersecurity teams that want to manage their risk and exposure effectively. In recent crises surrounding Ukraine, Israel, or Nagorno-Kabarakh, the targeting of private and civil society entities has often seemed counter-intuitive, disjointed, or downright arbitrary. What determines the likelihood of a water utilities provider being targeted versus a media organization or a university? When should security teams do more during crisis than simply raise their alert posture in the aggregate? A framework that links the utility of crisis hacking to an organization’s risk profile can allow for better assessment of situational risk. Some entities are vulnerable because of who their products serve; others carry greater symbolic liabilities. Seemingly arbitrary targeting of commercial enterprises is usually far from random but is driven by convenience where threat actors swarm those victims of which some awareness already exists. Cybersecurity preparedness now requires geopolitical sensibilities to match the infrastructural and market perspectives that often drive digital security planning. Key to understanding risk for enterprises and civil organizations during a geopolitical crisis is understanding the belligerents’ operational and strategic benefits. Geopolitical attacks fall into one of four categories: degradation, performative, signaling, and swarming. Some private firms are hacked during conflict because they are tied to the actions of a combatant. Strategically, such attacks are purely about degradation, by far the simplest situation for risk managers to model. It most often involves entities that might be calledsemi-stateactors that are directly supporting the capabilities of a belligerent. The Russian attempt to degrade Ukrainian national security capabilities in February 2022 byhacking Viasat, the satellite telecommunications Kyiv’s armed forces relied on, is a clear example. The type of spillover attack that most security teams will be familiar with is the performative attack where firms, products, and individuals linked to private enterprise are targeted because of their symbolic tie to a conflict. Performative attacks are also the form of cyber engagement most feared by cybersecurity teams, despite them often being simple exercises in disruption (i.e., DDoS or site vandalism). The targeting can appear arbitrary, the demands irrational or deceptive, and the off-ramps less about cybersecurity and more about sensitive political or public relations optics. Though not tied to a crisis, thenow-famous 2014 attack on Sony Picturesby the hacking group Guardians of Peace – deemed by the US government to be an alias for North Korea’s Lazarus Group – is a prime example of performative engagement of a non-state entity. For weeks, compromised data regarding company activities, personnel, and creative projects was used to coerce the firm into a series of embarrassing admissions, culminating in the forced withdrawal – temporarily – of a movie about the assassination of North Korea’s Dear Leader.Only when federal involvement and media attention surgedin support of Sony did the cybersecurity threat diminish. Things now only get more complex. Ask an international relations professional why civilian and enterprise actors might be drawn into geopolitical crises and they would likely point out that both degradative and performative attacks often aren’t as tactical as they might appear (i.e., “X company is hacked because they make statements in support of Y party” or “A firm was targeted because they provide intelligence infrastructure support to B government”). Instead, they would likely note that national governments have for some years been using cyberspace as a strategic resource to signal their intentions. Cyberspace is a domain with distinct logics of engagement. Because interaction is not physical, opportunities for escalation are limited. This same dynamic also makes signaling difficult, though not impossible. One must be nuanced and quick enough in the execution. The result is an appealing resource for statesseeking to control escalationduring crisis and perhaps even create off-ramps toward de-escalation. As strategic planners in the West see it, using cyber means to hack opposition targets during crisis – including and, because avoiding escalation is key, perhaps especially non-government/military targets – works under three conditions: Cyber operations are often useful alternatives to kinetic ones. If an attack of sufficient digital scale and impact can be mustered, it can provide a means for proportionate tit-for-tat response without risking physical death or damage. Cyberattacks can accomplish the same effect if they are used to amplify the effects of another technique, such as taking down a sensor facility briefly to enable precision air strikes that avoid collateral damage (a la 2007’sOperation Orchard). Cyberattacks often give democratic leaders a dual-use benefit insofar as foreign adversaries likely don’t see digital attacks as overly threatening but – as research tells us – domestic publics consider them to be strong statements of resolve. It’s easy to see the value in appearing strong at home but not overly assertive abroad. The result is a capacity for massaging crisis so long as sufficient precision, visibility, and credibility in the signals being sent to one’s adversaries can be crafted. That often means picking non-state targets that are highly visible, where disruption will be impactful but irreversible, and where an attack is not expected. Enterprise entities and civil organizations fit the bill. Recent geopolitical crises have seen a relatively novel addition to operational and strategic characteristics of conflict spillover: swarming attacks. In the recent case of Hamas’s attack on Israel, civilian hacking entities and proxies for countries like Iran, Israel, Syria, and Russia have hit private firms, media entities, and state digital infrastructure alike. It is the volume of sudden activity that is most distinct, as many of the attacks since October 7 have been highly unsophisticated (and, by recent reports, highly uncoordinated). It is one thing to understand why geopolitical spillover impacts private enterprise but another to be able to assign any kind of probability of risk to them. Fortunately, research on global cyber conflict and enterprise cybersecurity provide a reasonable starting point for dealing with this uncertainty. Scholars and policy commentators are interested in linking the realities of cyber operations to situational risk profiles, particularly for non-degradation threats for which traditional security assessment processes tend to be sufficient. Performative attacks come with perhaps the most obvious set of threat indicators. Companies that are “named and shamed” during geopolitical crisis moments tend to have one of two characteristics. First, their symbolic profile is constitutionally indivisible in the context of the current conflict. This means that a firm from its statements, actions, or productions clearly underwrites one side in conflict. Media organizations that consistently toe a national line such as Russia’s Pravda are an example of this, but so are firms with leaders or major stakeholders belonging to ethnic, religious, or linguistic backgrounds pertinent to a crisis (e.g., Sheldon Adelson, whosecasino was famously hacked by Iranin 2014). Second, companies often self-associate with conflict by means of company or personal statements. The solution is one that more firms have been embracing in recent years: the incorporation of sociological risk metrics into cybersecurity planning. Cybersecurity spillover borne of state-based efforts to strategically signal begins with similar dynamics to one-shot performative activities. Simply put, using cyberspace to signal to a competitor is about identifying and impacting entities perceived to be centers of gravity for geopolitical crisis. While this is occasionally a national government element, avoiding escalation dictates avoiding military or similar targets. Then, the need to signal intention via the characteristics of an attack alone dictates maximizing the situational relevance of a target. Where the dynamics of spillover during strategic cyber operations differs is that utility can only be found in narrow windows during crisis. As research illustrates, cyber operations are imperfect tools for controlling escalation via signaling. Scholarshave arguedthat cyber operations are used to signal all the time, perhaps because there is little chance of them leading to escalation. Retaliatory cyber offensive capabilities are rarely “ready to go” or even existent at the time they are needed to react to crisis. Even where they do exist, signaling requires such specificity in target and effects that their impact would be uncertain or limited without further development (which can take too long). Moreover, leaders tend to be concerned that the characteristics of cyber actions directly against foreign governments (i.e., they often seem arbitrary and blunt force) might invite a cross-domain response if targeted too assertively. General unwillingness to use a non-cyber action where digital possibilities exist in some form makes cyber for cyber’s sake an unappealing prospect during crisis. The result is appeal in hacking to control escalation, but only against low-value, symbolic targets in society and private industry and only in limited windows of time. This second point is critical for cybersecurity teams, who would do well to be mindful of the temporality of geopolitical crises. Attacks on enterprise firms or civil society organizations by sophisticated cyber actors tend to only come around critical junctures. In particular, they occur during the opening days of a crisis where strategic competitors attempt to define the scope of a situation and the point where conflict clearly evolves into a new phase, such as theweeks following the Battle of Kyivin 2022 when pro-Russian cyberattacks absent since the invasion picked back up. Otherwise, spillover from signaling activities reduces in likelihood in inverse proportion to the rising difficulty of meaningful crisis communication. Finally, though a feature of recent geopolitical crises, the threat from potential swarming attacks on society and industry presents a unique challenge for security teams. In particular, attacks like those bypro-Ukrainian hackers on Russian society targetssince 2022 orpro-Hamas hacktivists on Western firmsthis year are united by a shared cause but otherwise seem to be poorly coordinated or not at all. Beyond assuming a performative attack logic, this makes preparation hard. Where there does appear to be a thread of risk management utility is in the commonality in recent incidents of a pre-existing relationship between companies and attackers. Groups like Molerats, Dark Storm, and Anonymous Sudan have each hit entities since the start of the Hamas-Israel conflict in 2022 for which they have established reputations for targeting. Few hackers change lanes even during crisis. There is much to be gained from using sociological representations of enterprise risk as a foundation for mapping the inclinations and mission profiles of potential crisis hackers. This decade’s threat of geopolitical spillover of cybersecurity threats is clear. What’s also clear is that effective risk management and threat assessment means an active defense posture that links sociological profiling of threat variables to intelligence about possible threat actors. Unfortunately, similar planning also drives Western adversaries likely to feature in future spillover events. It is easy to envision a future conflict that involves, say, Iran in which the Tehran regime directly leverages their network of proxy actors to hack based on pre-planned eventualities. In all cases, cybersecurity teams must persistently simulate and collaborate with information sharing geared toward an adaptive defense posture that consistently tailors and re-tailors internal practices toward shifting geopolitical conditions. That said, security teams and the firms they protect would do well to remember that cyber spillover from geopolitical crisis is typically the stuff of disruption, not catastrophe. Being pulled into conflict defined by broad societal forces can allow companies to strengthen their image, so long as the association is not due to some scandalous statement. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent targeting of Western technology firms, for instance,companies like Meta dramatically improved their authorityas neutral advocates for shared security principles by taking common-sense steps to respond to service disruption, leading conversation about the situation’s technical aspects, and establishing ways to impartially shape the developing crisis (e.g., by supporting refugee funds). In short, geopolitical cybersecurity spillover need not be the random emergency that many envision; it is simply a set of risks that can be modeled, prepared for, and even turned into opportunity.

Here’s how cyber teams can cope The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  There’s no question that a career as a top security leader is rewarding and something to aspire to. But before you consider taking that career path, there are some lessons to be learned from a recent case that shows just how tough a job it can be. You’ve gotten the education, paid your dues and you’re ready to tackle the role of CSO or CISO, to make the big decisions and determine how security will be a key part of your firm and what it does. Before you start down this road, or even if you are continuing down this road, there are some lessons that can be learned from the trial ofthe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) versus SolarWinds and its CISO Timothy Brown. It’s an important case and one that demonstrates potential severe repercussions for CISOs and has even caused some to reconsider the role. How would you have handled the situation if you were in charge? TheSEC has accused Brownof misleading investors by not disclosing “known risks” and not accurately representing the company’s cybersecurity measures during and before the2020 Sunburst cyberattackthat affected thousands of customers in government agencies and companies globally. “SolarWinds violated reporting and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act; and Brown aided and abetted the company’s violations,” the SEC said in a press release. The claimed failures, including not abiding by the statements that the company made on its website regarding their patterns and practices for developing their software as well as password policies internal to the company. The SEC complains in its filings that the company did not disclose cybersecurity risks independently from other risks, given SolarWinds’ role and industry (it sells a network and applications monitoring platform called Orion), nor pay extra risk attention to targeted attacks and the disclosure needs surrounding them. The SEC found internal emails in which the CISO indicated that the company was not abiding by its public security development lifecycle statement. When communication indicated that improvement was needed internally, there was no communication in the SEC filing that these actions were being worked on. When others in the network security team were indicating deficiencies in network access and VPN protocols, it appears that actions were not appropriately taken. There were emails, internal messages, and text messages documenting internal knowledge that customers were at risk using the software as well as increasing evidence that attackers knew of the situation as well. However, during this time no disclosures were made to the SEC or even to customers at risk. Like many attacks these days, it appears that the attackers first came into the network via remote access and a VPN vulnerability. The attackers inserted the malicious software into SolarWinds products which in turn was delivered to over 18,000 customers worldwide. When early attacks were noted, impacted firms asked whether other attacks had been seen in the wild by other customers, and the CISO communicated that he had not seen examples. When an 8-K statement was finally filed acknowledging the security issue, the SEC indicated that “it was materially misleading in several respects, including its failure to disclose that the vulnerability at issue had been actively exploited against SolarWinds’ customers multiple times over at least a six-month period.” Passwords and password handling are key concerns for any business, but a security firm should pay closer attention. It’s vital that if you have a stated policy you follow that policy. If your internal needs and practices are such that a mandated password change and complexity is not attainable, then you need to change your processes to work with the needs without decreasing your security posture. These days the mandate ofchanging passwordsis beginning to be put aside as a best practice and instead looking for ways to increase your security with the use of alternative authentication methodologies such as authentication applications and other two-factor authentication technologies. Vendors should code their applications to encourage such better practices of software handling as well as encourage the use internally. Software and hardware devices should not have any default passwords built into the platform. These types of settings expose these devices to attack using relatively easy techniques are far too common and should never occur. When passwords are used in applications they should be handled in an appropriate manner and encrypted where needed. Databases should never have default passwords, nor should they be stored in an insecure method. In addition, any passwords used in a software development process should never be stored in software repositories. In the case of SolarWinds, a public GitHub repro included credentials belonging to SolarWinds. Password handling in software development can be fraught with bad practices. I have personally seen FTP usernames and passwords sent in emails to consultants and developers working on a joint project. Too often the demand for getting a project done in a timely manner will lead individuals into making insecure decisions. The SEC also indicated that SolarWinds did not limit administrative access to those who needed access. Too often in developer networks administrative rights are used too widely and not limited. Internal staff expressed concerns that user access would lead to losses of organizational assets and personal data. Furthermore, it appears that logging of this access did not occur. It’s key in any sized network or organization that logging resources are allocated appropriately. While this has been deemed to be an attack launched by a nation-state, the SEC indicated that the exposure to vulnerability could have been remedied through basic steps. They make the claim that the failure to comply with basic security practices also does not excuse hiding these failures from investors. In addition, the company knew that there were security issues surrounding their managed service products. The company indicated that the risks surrounding their MSP products were significant. Furthermore, Brown and management accepted the risks of legacy software were so great that it could not be fixed in a timely manner. The bottom line is not to be a SolarWinds — look at your own failings and ensure that you are honest with yourself, your customers, and more importantly your investors. If your internal meetings indicate that you need to immediately take action, do so. Being in a leadership position means that the buck has to stop with you. What sort of CISO are you? What would you have done differently if you were in charge of the situation?

Here’s how cyber teams can cope The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  As Ukraine and its allies find themselves in the crosshairs of Russian hacking groups, the cyber realm has become a virtual battlefield of strategic warfare. Among them, a series of politically motivated distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks by the pro-Russian hacktivist group NoName057(16) has resulted in a wave of public coverage detailing the group’s operations. While cyber threat analysts have paid much attention to the technical components, and media reports have covered much of the political outfall of the DDoS attacks, little has been said about the group’s persona. As of this writing, NoName057(16) is the most active pro-Russian DDoS group hitting Western websites. With 1174 attacks against targets in 32 Western countries, the group wasresponsible for 31% of all pro-Russian DDoS campaignsin the first half of 2023. Yet, what is rather unusual about NoName057(16) is its continuous effort to build an online community of comrades and the strategies they employ to do so. NoName057(16) has come a long way since May 2022, whenWestern media referred to it as a “little-known hacker group.”In the past year, the group has gone from a seemingly harmless rogue operation to an organized collective of volunteer cyber partisans. With nearly 60,000 subscribers to its Telegram channel and over 15,000 subscribers to its Telegram bot, NoName057(16) appears to have been successful in building an online community. This can in part be attributed to the group’s distinct technical targeting process, that uses volunteers to download and install a bot on their devices to carry out its DDoS attacks. Unlike other groups, NoName057(16) provides financial incentives to motivate individuals to join itscrowdsourced botnet project, DDoSia, which was launched on Telegram in July 2022. Has NoName057(16) created a new niche in the hacking community? Let’s have a look. NoName057(16)first appeared on Telegramon March 11, 2022. By June 22, 2022, the group hadamassed 10,000 subscribers. In its first post, the group boasted about its successful DDoS attacks against Ukrainian websites. NoName057(16) also providedinsight into its goals and strategy, which was centered on targeting any Ukrainian media resources that “engage in pernicious Russophobic propaganda.” Six months later, the group alsocreated a Telegram channel in English, likely to extend its audience base. In the beginning, NoName057(16) wasfocused on targeting Ukrainian newspaper and TV channel websites, as well as individual journalists. In June 2022, the group shifted its targeting. NoName057(16)’s attacks became more news-driven, evidenced by the increased targeting of government websites in Estonia, Lithuania, and Poland. Thegroup stated, “…our team has expanded the geography of DDoS attacks. Now NoName057(16) conducts raids on the websites of all countries unfriendly to Russia.” This message was subsequently reinforced in thegroup’s manifesto, published on July 26, 2023, which attributed “Russophobia” as a justification for its actions. Now, NoName057(16) targets any country that expresses support for Ukraine, focusing primarily on government websites, banks, and energy providers. Whereas other groups have come and gone, NoName057(16) has been consistent in its activities for the past 18 months, conducting at least one DDoS attack per day. The group rarely diverts from its systematic attack procedure, which is commonly linked with the news cycle, but when they do it is reactive. For example, on December 15, 2022, the group carried out a DDoS attack on the Polish Parliament website afterPoland recognized Russiaas a state sponsor of terrorism. The group’s modus operandi seems to encompass three components: disinformation, intimidation, and chaos creation. The disinformation component is evidenced by the continuous attacks against numerous Ukrainian media sources. The intimidation component consists of repeated attacks against the same target. AsNoName057(16) puts it: “repetition is the mother of learning.” Lastly, chaos creation is evidenced by the70-plus DDoS attacksagainst Spain during the weeks prior and immediately after the country’s general election in July 2023. Similar events took place leading up to theCzech presidential electionin January and thePolish parliamentary electionsin October. NoName057(16) has no enigmatic leader and there is no evidence for who financially sponsors the group, or if they have government linkages.It is characterizedby its military-like discipline and the calculated, repetitive nature of its attacks. The group is far more rigorous in its target reconnaissance than any other pro-Russian hacktivist group. It also publishes evidence of the global unavailability of the targeted websites on the CheckHost website, most likely to boost their own ego. What is also unique about the group is its technical targeting process that is completely reliant on volunteers to carry out its DDoS operations. A target list is updated daily and is distributed by the group administrators via encrypted C2 servers. The execution of the attacks, therefore, relies on a group of Russian sympathizers who volunteer their private devices and who are paid in cryptocurrency for their participation. Many questions remain regarding who is responsible for choosing the targets and uploading the list, but there is a strong possibility a core group of individuals make these executive decisions. Also peculiar is that unlike any other hacking group in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, NoName057(16) does not restrict its user base and is willing to mix ideology with financial incentives to recruit individuals to join their efforts. NoName057(16)launched its crowdsourced botnet, DDoSia, in July 2022. To make the attack toolkit more accessible, it also has a Telegram channel both in Russian and English for instructions and support. Its toolkitwas also hosted on GitHubuntil recently, but it has since been taken down, which is curious given the volume of illicit content that continues to be made available on the website. A parallel can be drawn between the cyber operations of NoName057(16) and the IT Army of Ukraine, which also has a fully automated DDoS bot that targets Russian organizations. What sets NoName057(16) apart is its integrated payment platform, which is hard to track since the groupuses the open-source cryptocurrency TON for payouts. Experts from Radware, a cybersecurity provider, claim it is “basically untraceable.” NoName057(16) therefore engages individuals in a gamification challenge that consists of downloading and installing the DDoSia bot on their devices, which allows the group to generate higher DDoS traffic. On September 20, 2023, the groupteased the idea of releasing its own cryptocurrencyfor the DDoSia project. This has now become a reality. On November 24, 2023, NoName057(16)announced dCoin, an electronic currency equal to one Russian ruble, which can be withdrawn and converted into TON that volunteers can then send to their crypto wallet. The group further explained thatvolunteers will be compensatedbased on their contribution to the attacks or “combat merit,” as well as their rank. The introduction of dCoin makes the group’s payout platform even more elusive and demonstrates the extent to which NoName057(16) is willing to go to create a unique brand for itself. Moreover, the group thrives on media attention and regularly reposts screenshots of news articles they are mentioned in, as demonstrated in arecent postcaptioned “they write about us,” followed by a winky face emoji. Such actions also reiterate the working pattern of the group. It appears that the structure is horizontal, given that targets are chosen by an unknown group of administrators, but it is also vertical, because the group relishes on success reporting reinforced by lexicon such as “we” and “friends”, coupled with frequent posts detailing the successes of other pro-Russian hacking groups. These efforts are further reinforced by NoName057(16)’s posts about IT sector news, as well as educational content followed by the hashtag#InfoWithout or #Info-freesuch as, for example,informative postsabout Public Key Infrastructure. Ironically, this series of posts also includes information onhow to combat new cybersecurity threatsandhow to protect yourself from cyber extortion. In 2022, the group evenconducted pollsto ask its followers questions such as, “Are we continuing to torment Lithuania?” Finally, perhaps the most innovative branding attempt by NoName057(16) is thedevelopment of Telegram emoticon-stickerswith its signature bear and bear claw, and increasing user engagement via sticker pack competitions for the group’s Telegram subscribers. Besides the group’s clearer objective to disrupt and create inconveniences for its victims, a persistent trend has been its online trolling of Westerners. For example, on October 9, 2023, NoName057(16)posted a memepoking fun at Microsoft for spying on its users, with Google, Apple, and Linux appearing relatively inferior in their espionage tactics. The use of stickers themselves is a form of trolling, wherein usually the Russian bear is dominating its Western counterpart. GIFs of Western leaders holding the Russian flag is another attempt at provocation. The group also made fun of the antivirus company Avastwith an imagecaptioned “the most useless things,” showing a deformed spoon, fork, and key, along with the Avast logo. Another interesting element of the group is its ambiguous relationship with the Killnet group. NoName057(16) has gone fromposting about how Killnet is doing “everything right”to threatening a journalist for suggesting a potential affiliation between the two groups to more recentlydeclaring a joint attackwith a multitude of groups, including Killnet. The objective behind this attitude is most likely to humiliate Western threat intelligence companies who have labeled NoName057(16) as a “lone wolf DDoS group.” After all, the name NoName057(16) can be considered a form of trolling, as the group has not explained the origins of its name. What comes next for NoName057(16)? It appears the group is here to stay as it updates and ameliorates its capabilities, and as its DDoS attacks become more sophisticated. Over the past 18 months, the group has evolved from a small initiative to a thriving pro-Russian hacking community. NoName057(16) has been able to recruit thousands of “cyber militia” who actively support the Russian regime, which has progressively allowed them to carry out DDoS attacks on a larger scale. Does the group pose a severe security threat to the West? On the one hand, NoName057(16) has become better at choosing which services to target, with a growing focus on websites belonging to critical infrastructure companies. On the other hand, the group mostly stuck to the same targeting strategy, which has become repetitive and low impact. Despite the group’s illusions of grandeur, NoName057(16) is not a top-tier threat actor and thus far it has only been observed carrying out short-lived DDoS attacks. What stands out about NoName057(16) is how it has created a new niche in the hacking community: a platform that remunerates volunteers for their participation that other hacking groups are likely to replicate. The group’s development of a vertically integrated business model that leverages crypto rewards to attract individuals has proven highly efficient. So far, the consequences of this new form of gamification remain unknown, leaving many open questions about the future of the group. Will the NoName057(16) community continue to grow? Or will a plethora of copycats emerge and take its place? Does the group have a future beyond the Russo-Ukraine war? If so, what will its targeting procedure be?

Top 4 LLM threats to the enterprise,https://www.csoonline.com/article/1294996/top-4-llm-threats-to-the-enterprise.html,"Prompt injection, prompt extraction, new phishing schemes, and poisoned models are the most likely risks organizations face when using large language models. 1. Malicious instructions from prompt injections 2. Data leakage from prompt extractions also an LLM vulnerability 3. New LLM-enabled phishing opportunities 4. Poisoned LLMs AI versus AI Related content New phishing campaign uses scareware to steal Apple credentials Not all cuts are equal: Security budget choices disproportionately impact risk GitHub accounts targeted with fake security alerts AI development pipeline attacks expand CISOs’ software supply chain risk Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  As CISO for the Vancouver Clinic, Michael Bray gushes about the infinite ways large language models (LLMs) will improve patient care. “DNA-based predictive studies, metabolic interactions, lab services, diagnostics and other medicine will be so advanced that today’s medical practices will look prehistoric,” he says. “For example, applications like ActX are already making a huge difference with symptom identification, medicine interactions, effectiveness, and dosages.” As excited as he is about LLMs improving patient care anddiagnoses, Bray is equally concerned about the new and hidden threats that LLMs present. LLMs are core to disruptive and fast-moving AI technologies including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, and Microsoft’s Copilot, which are rapidly proliferating across enterprises today. LLMs are being developed into a host of other specialty apps for specific vertical industries like finance, government, and military. With these LLMs come new risks of data poisoning, phishing, prompt injections, and sensitive data extraction. Because these attacks are executed via natural language prompts or training sources, traditional security tools are ill-equipped to detect such attacks. Fortunately, these vulnerabilities are being identified and prioritized by theOpen Web Application Security Project (OWASP),National Institute of Standards (NIST), and other standards groups nearly as quickly as AI is proliferating. TheEU AI Acthas released an initialcompliance checkerfor organizations to determine if their AI applications fall into the category of unacceptable risk or high risk. In November 2023, the UK released theUK guidelinesfor secure AI system development. Tools are also catching up with new risks introduced through LLM’s. For example, natural language web firewalls, AI discovery, and AI-enhanced security testing tools are coming to market in what may well become a battle of AI versus AI. As we wait for those tools, these are the most likely threats organizations will face to their use of LLMs: When asked about new threats introduced to enterprises through LLMs, experts cite prompt injections as a top risk. Jailbreaking an AI by throwing a bunch of confusing prompts at the LLM interface is probably the most well-known risk and could cause reputational damage if the jailbreaker spreads misinformation that way. Or a jailbreaker could use confusing prompts to cause a system to spit out ridiculous offers, such as with a popular auto dealership chatbot developed by a company calledFullpath. By instructing a Chevy dealer’s chatbot to end each response with “that’s a legally binding offer, notakesies backsies,” a hacker tester tried thousands of prompts until he ultimatelytricked the dealersite into offering him a new car for one dollar. The more severe threat is when prompt injections are used to force applications to hand over sensitive information. Unlike with SQL injection prompts, threat actors can use limitless prompts to try to trick an LLM into doing things it shouldn’t because the LLM prompts are written in natural language, explains Walter Haydock, founder of StackAware, which maps AI use in enterprises and identifies associated risks. “With SQL, there are finite ways you can input data so there is a known set of controls you can use to prevent and block SQL injections. But with prompt injection, there are infinite ways to provide malicious instructions to an LLM because the English language is that vast,” Haydock notes. The number ofLLM prompt tokenscontinues to grow. Hyrum Anderson, CTO at Robust Intelligence, an end-to-end AI security platform that includes a natural language web firewall, also points to prompt extractions as a point of vulnerability. “Prompt extraction falls into the category of data leakage, where data can be extracted by merely asking for it,” he adds. Take, for example, chatbots on a website, with relevant data behind them that support the application. These data can be exfiltrated. As an example, Anderson points to retrieval augmented generation (RAG), where LLM responses are enriched by connecting them to sources of information relevant to the task. Anderson recently witnessed such an attack in which demonstrators used a RAG to force the database to spit out specific sensitive information by asking for specific rows and tables in the database. To prevent this type of database leakage, Anderson urges caution when connecting public-facing RAG apps to databases. “If you don’t want the RAG app user to see the entire database, then you should restrict access at the user interface to the LLM,” he adds. “Security-minded organizations should steel their APIs against natural-language pull requests, restrict access, and use an AI firewall to block malicious requests.” LLMs also open a new vector for phishers to trick people into clicking their links, Anderson continues. “Say I’m a financial analyst using a RAG app to scrape documents from the internet to find out a company’s earnings, but in that supply chain of data are instructions for an LLM to respond with a phishing link. So, say I ask it to find the most up-to-date information in the trove of data it sent, and it says ‘click here.’ And then I click a phishing link.” This kind of phish is powerful since the user is explicitly seeking an answer from the LLM. Furthermore, traditional anti-phishing tools may not see these malicious links, Anderson adds. He advises CISOs to update their employee training programs to include critical thinking about RAG responses, and to use emerging web-based tools that can scan RAG data for natural-language prompt injections that encourage users to click links. Models from open-source repositories and the data used to train LLMs can also be poisoned, adds Diana Kelley CISO at Protect AI, a platform for AI and ML security. “The biggest threats could be in the model itself or the data the LLM was trained on, who trained it, and where it was downloaded from,” she explains. “OSS models run with high privileges, but few companies scan them before use and the quality of the training data directly impacts the reliability and accuracy of the LLM. To see and manage AI-related risks, and prevent poisoning attacks, CISOs need to govern the ML supply chain and track components throughout the lifecycle.” That is, if CISOs are even aware of what applications are using LLMs and for what purposes. Many common workforce applications used in enterprises today are embedding the latest AI capabilities in their system updates, sometimes without the knowledge of the CISO. Because these LLMs are integrated into third-party applications and web interfaces, discovery and visibility become even more murky. So, an AI policy addressing the entire data supply chain is key, says Haydock of StackAware. Regarding these fourth-party risks. “It’s understanding how these apps are using, training, accessing, and retaining your data,” he adds. The US Government, arguably the largest network in the world, certainly understands the value of AI security policy as it seeks to leverage the promise of AI across government and military applications. In October 2023, the Whitehouse issued anexecutive order(EO) for safe AI development and use. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), plays a critical role in executing the executive order and has generated an AIroadmapthat incorporates key CISA-led actions as directed by the EO — along with additional actions CISA is leading to support critical infrastructure owners and operators as they navigate the adoption of AI. As a result of the executive order, several key government agencies have already identified, nurtured, and appointed new chief AI officers responsible for coordinating their agency’s use of AI, promoting AI innovation while managing risks from their agency’s use of AI, according to Lisa Einstein, CISA’s senior advisor for AI. “With AI embedded into more of our everyday applications, having a person who understands AI—and who understands the positive and negative implications of integrating AI—is critical,” Einstein explains. “Risks related to LLM use are highly contextual and use-case specific based on industry, whether it be healthcare, schools, energy, or IT. So, AI champions need to be able to work with industry experts to identify risks specific to the context of their industries.” Within government agencies, Einstein points to the Department of Homeland Security’s Chief AI Officer Eric Hysen, who is also DHS’s CIO. Hysen coordinates AI efforts acrossDHS components, she explains, including the Transportation Security  Administration, which uses AI to detect prohibited items in luggage. DHS, in fact,leverages AIin many instances to secure the homeland at ports of entry and along the border, as well as in cyberspace to protect children, defend against cyber threats, and even to combat the malicious use of AI. As LLM threats evolve, it will take equally innovative AI-enabled tools and techniques to combat them. AI-enhanced penetration testing and red teaming, threat intelligence, anomaly detection, and incident response are but some of the tool types that are quickly adapting to fight these new threats.

Apply proof of life test for all breach claims Forensic science can help solve a cybercrime Cyber criminals take advantage of real-world events Communications and response plan are key, even if it’s a false flag How to respond to a claimed breach on third-party Can a false breach improve the incident response plan?

Organizations should plan for false breach claims and must be ready to follow the necessary steps to confirm whether there has been an attack while keeping to regulatory obligations. In August, Australia’s local domain name registrar, auDA wasforced to correct the recordafter cyber criminals claimed to have accessed its data. auDA alerted relevant authorities and made public statements, at the same time it conducted investigations which found no evidence criminals had accessed its systems or data. auDA took the right steps in taking the claim seriously, but can organizations prepare for this kind of incident and even use it as a learning experience? As a seasoned incident investigator, Christopher Pogue, US director of digital forensics and incident response at CyberCX, has spent thousands of hours helping organizations make sound, timely decisions in these situations. His advice: Take action immediately. Assume the worst, while hoping for the best. Answering the board, the SEC and regulators afterwards, CIOS need to be able to say they followed the procedure and it turned out to be a false positive. “That’s a great outcome, versus not doing any of those things but just dodging the bullet this time. Your regulators are going to frown on that and then they’re going to become very interested in what your posture looks,” Pogue says. To guide efforts while undertaking investigations, investigators will work to verify the legitimacy of a claimed breach, and there are two elements in proving claims—confirming that the organization’s systems and data have been accessed and verifying the legitimacy of the cybercriminals making the claim. Investigators first want to satisfy this ‘proof of life’ test when cybercriminals make claims they have infiltrated an organization’s systems or they’re in possession of their data. Bad actors might be saying: ‘show me the money’ but organizations will respond with ‘show me the proof’. “It’s ‘show me this is a real thing’, which might be in the form of some data, like data samples or data dumps, and that you’re not just making it up trying to get me to give you money arbitrarily,” says Pogue. But there’s more to this than just passing the proof test. By sharing some of the data, it also starts to give investigators important clues about the nature of the attack. “It starts the process of finding out where they actually broke in,” he says. “It lets us do what’s called data reduction very quickly so I can go from potentially thousands of systems where data is stored to just a few.” Mandiant director David Wong says that if the criminals provide a list of files they claim to have accessed, investigators can go into those systems, pick out one or more files, and then ask the criminals to produce the nominated files from the list as proof. “If they can actually produce them, then that’s the proof we’re looking for,” Wong says. Similarly, this process also provides investigators clues about the timeline and extent of a breach, which helps investigators begin their work by narrowing down when and how the breach occurred. “When we’re working with certain actors, it gives us additional information to figure out when they hacked in and which systems they hacked into based on the data,” says Wong. Investigators then also seek to confirm that cyber criminals are who they say they are and not opportunists looking to hijack other criminal identities with fake claims. They want to identify cyber criminals who may impersonate well-known threat actors to create confusion, and there are numerous ways to sniff out copycats. “They might use the same email address, or come from the same IP address, or they’ll send the same kind of message to 100 different companies and see whoever falls prey to it that didn’t bother to check with an intelligence provider,” Wong adds. To help prove their bonafides, and ultimately to try and get organizations to pay up, some criminals will even employ middlemen or brokers who vouch for their credibility. “However, most organizations and intelligence providers do not engage with these intermediaries,” Wong says. When verifying cyberattacks, and sifting out false claims, investigators can draw on well-established forensic principles. One of the ways investigators will look to confirm a breach is by applying Locard’s exchange principle used in forensic science, which says that every contact leaves a trace. Likewise, actions in the digital world leave behind traces. With cybersecurity, digital footprints from a breach can be found in various locations such as event logs, network logs, and file modification timestamps. “When an attacker gains access to a system, they don’t create a user ID called ‘hacker’. They take over someone’s credentials, effectively going native. Investigators look at lots of different components to help discern what’s legitimate and what’s not,” Pogue says. The process is to start working backwards to find the individual components, according to Pogue. “It’s both art and science,” requiring deep technical prowess combined with finely tuned human instinct. A cybersecurity team with diverse skills, which can include individuals skilled in particular areas, is the starting point. Depending on the nature of the attack, this might be Linux, network analysis, Windows registry and so on. Technology-assisted analysis helps narrow down vast amounts of data, but human intuition remains vital in identifying patterns and anomalies. These include small evidentiary components, such as the time of day a file was accessed and whether it is a system or a file that user typically accesses. And the IP address associated with these logins, that’s the science side, Pogue says. The art is human analysis. “We look for anomalies within those logs and activities to show us those deviations, and sometimes those deviations are very subtle, and sometimes they are completely overt. Human beings have brains that are amazing association machines. We can spot patterns and anomalies like nothing else.” Threat actors are well-informed and responsive to news and information about organizations, looking to target exploits, security weaknesses or spin up false alarms if an organization appears unprepared or has suffered other events. “There’s a risk of subsequent attacks as a result of an organization being known as not being particularly well prepared,” says Pogue. Attackers are experts at communications, utilizing dark web channels, mobile phones, and encrypted chat platforms like Signal. “They know who’s responding well and who’s not. Who’s getting breached and who isn’t. This is their business. So, they know all about it,” Pogue says. Other communication channels used by threat actors include Tor chat rooms and anonymous email services. “Organizations need to be aware of these channels when investigating breach claims,” Wong says. To counter this, if there’s been an arrest, law enforcement will look to gain some intelligence by assuming the nickname or handle of the criminal and emulate that person for as long as possible to gather intelligence. This helps feed into behavioral analysis required to prove the legitimacy of cyber criminals when dealing with an incident. Being human, they make mistakes like forgetting to use anonymity tools such as Tor or VPNs. “Behavioral analysis of these mistakes can help identify and trace these actors,” says Wong. An organization needs to have done its due diligence and practiced its incident response plan, which includes how to handle claims that turn out to be false. “This is where a strong, well-practiced relationship between legal, corporate communications, and security teams, including any outside support or retainer services available, really pays off for the organization,” says Netscout CISO, Debby Briggs. Being able to engage a team across a range of disciplines to discuss the pros and cons of the situation is valuable. Likewise, it’s helpful to make sense of and learn from what others have done in similar situations. “At times, you may decide to take no action on the report of a false incident. Responding to a report may only serve to legitimize these reports and increase the visibility to a false statement and bad actor,” Briggs says. Mandiant’s Wong says organizations need to be prepared to respond to breach alerts effectively, even if they turn out to be false, by undertaking drills beforehand. “Having a well-defined plan, conducting tabletop exercises, and ensuring that the right personnel are informed and trained are essential,” he says.While handling breach announcements, organizations need toconsider their communication strategy carefully, aiming to be transparent and factual while avoiding unnecessary panic or reputational damage. It should be along the lines of ‘we’re investigating a suspected security incident until there’s actual evidence that data was taken or customers were impacted.’ Otherwise, “it’s hard to have to walk it back,” Wong says. In the case of auDA, it turned out to be related to a third party and didn’t involve auDA data. But assessing the credibility of claimed breaches on third parties can be more challenging because it’s done at arm’s reach, not directly. It’s good practice to maintain an updated list of all third parties that includes the scope of services they provide, the name of the internal business owner, the main point of contact, the type of data involved, and whether the third party maintains access to the network. When facing a claimed breach on a third-party network or systems, a good rule of thumb in analyzing the credibility of a specific report would be to first examine the source of the report. “Consulting experts who are familiar with the background and history of the reporter is a good practice. All reports should be investigated,” Netscout’s Briggs says. “When an incident with a third party arises, there are a number of questions that need to be addressed before an organization can decide its next best course of action. Generally, it needs to consider the amount and type of data that’s involved, as well as the nature of services that are being provided,” she says. Briggs recommends formulating a risk score for each third party to help prioritize and analyze their associated risk. This can be applied in the event of a third-party breach. “Depending upon the situation, an organization may consider suspending access to its network, out of an abundance of caution, while the investigation is ongoing.” Acting on a false breach alert can be an opportunity to test out the organization’s response plan in a way that shifts tabletop exercises to real-world drills. There’s always something to be discovered, even if something turns out to be a non-incident. “Look at the playbook. Did your team follow the playbook? If it’s a vendor incident, did it play out the way you thought it would? Learn from every single incident,” Wong says. Briggs says that incident plans should address a range of different scenarios and if these haven’t been considered previously, the CISO may want to add them to their planning. “You should be prepared to address any scenario publicly, to your customers and to your employees,” she says. Employees should know who to contact about incidents if they are the recipients of a breach report. And the experience of a false breach can sometimes reveal that the point of contact and process for escalating breaches may have gaps or problems. “A well-tested and practiced incident response plan is an important tool to have implemented ahead of time. And a plan tailored to your organization should set out individual roles and specific procedures your organization needs to take depending upon the specific circumstances at hand,” she says. CyberCX’s Pogue says a post-incident review, even if it’s a false breach, is vital to see what worked and where additional training and education may be needed, or where the playbook for the incident response plan may need to be updated. False breaches should also be plotted on the organization’s risk matrix. “We can look at the risk register and the likelihood and the impact of this kind of breach on a risk matrix. We can see, had this been real, it would have been catastrophic,” Pogue says. On the other hand, it can open conversations, about when it’s appropriate to increase the organization’s risk appetite and even add some additional steps to qualify security incidents. But the bottom line is that learning from false positives is crucial. “You operate under the assumption that it’s the worst-case scenario, that this data really has been compromised, and you start all of those activities, because it’s far easier as the CISO to call a timeout if you find out it is not a real breach,” he says. “The unfortunate truth of being a CISO is that your every decision is going to be evaluated after the fact: Did you wait too long? Did you inform the right people? Did you do all of these things? The last thing you want is not to follow the playbooks and incident response plan. Now you look foolish, the organization suffers loss of customer confidence, loss of market share and all sorts of negative things like that. It’s unnecessary, self-inflicted damage,” Pogue says.

6 most common types of software supply chain attacks explained,https://www.csoonline.com/article/570743/6-most-common-types-of-software-supply-chain-attacks-explained.html,"Not all software supply chain attacks are the same.

Here’s how cyber teams can cope The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Software supply chain incidents have been making headlines recently. Despite similarities among these security incidents, not all supply chain attacks are created equal. The umbrella term “software supply chain attack” covers any instance where an attacker interferes with or hijacks the software manufacturing process (software development lifecycle) such that multiple consumers of the finished product or service are impacted detrimentally. This can happen when code libraries or individual components being used in a software build are tainted, when software update binaries are Trojanized, code-signing certificates are stolen, or even when a server hosting software-as-a-service (SaaS) is compromised. With any software supply chain attack, attackers interject themselves either upstream or midstream to cast their malicious activities and their after-effects downstream to many users. As such, compared to an isolated security breach, successful supply chain attacks are of a much a larger scale with a far-reaching impact. Any code repository or library might contain malicious code despite efforts to monitor for and remove suspect packages. While repositories such as GitHub are taking positive measures to keep malware off their sites, attackers are finding ways to successfully make their code available to unsuspecting developers. The problem is growing. Phylum’sQ3 2023 Evolution of Software Supply Chain Security Reportrevealed increases in suspicious packages across most categories. Of 3 million packages scanned, more than 10,000 files referenced known malicious URLs. Nearly 86,000 contained pre-compiled binaries, which makes them hard to scan for malware. Another 5,500 attempted to obfuscate their code, and 5,000 were registered by authors with throw-away email accounts. More significant, the report showed a shift in tactics where more malware authors are targeting specific companies rather than taking a broader approach. Nearly 1,000 malicious packages targeted specific groups or businesses, representing a 47.4% increase over Q2 2023. The goals of these targeted attacks include credential harvesting and source code or intellectual property theft. Developers don’t appear to be making the software supply chain safer with their practices. Phylum noted that developers download about 24 billion packages from the Javascript package registry npm each week, but almost none of them verified the integrity of the downloaded code. Attackers know this, and that could encourage them to launch broader campaigns such as large-scale ransomware attacks or botnets in the future, the report stated. Here we examine six different techniques used in recent real-world, successful software supply chain attacks. With most software supply chain attacks, an attacker breaches an upstream server or code repository and injects malicious payload (e.g., malicious line of code or Trojanized updates). That payload is then distributed downstream to many users. From a technical standpoint, however, this isn’t always the case. The Codecov supply chain attack is one such example. Although the incident hasdrawn comparisonsto theSolarWinds breach, there are stark differences between the two attacks. The SolarWinds supply chain breach was the work of sophisticated threat actors who altered a legitimate update binary, SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll, which was part of the SolarWinds IT performance monitoring product Orion. As previously analyzed byFireEye, the malicious code contained in the RefreshInternal() method of the counterfeit DLL is shown below. This method invokes the HTTP-based backdoor when Orion loads the Inventory Manager plugin: Version 2019.4.5200.9083 of the backdoored DLL with the malicious RefreshInternal method The SolarWinds upstream attack, however, only took full force when the altered binary made its way downstream to over 18,000 SolarWinds Orion customers including US government agencies. In Codecov’s case, however, no malicious code was distributed downstream, but the after-effects of the attack were. Codecov attackers had obtained credentials from a flawed Docker image creation process that could be used to modify the Codecov Bash Uploader, as per the officialsecurity advisory. The attackers then modified the Codecov Bash Uploader hosted on the Codecov server itself to collect environment variables being uploaded from customers’ continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) environments: Modified line of Codecov’s Bash Uploader that collected environment variables and sent these to the attacker IP address Although Codecov Bash Uploader script lived (and continues to live) on the Codecov server itself at codecov[.]io/bash,thousands of repositorieswere pointing to the link already to send information upstream from their CI/CD environments to this Bash Uploader. As such, the malicious code remained present only at the (compromised) upstream server without any downstream distribution of the code occurring, because the so-called downstream repositories were already pointing to the Codecov server that hosted the Bash Uploader script. Yet, these downstream repositories were affected by this attack as they were configured to upload their data to the Codecov’s Bash Uploader: In fact,Codecov attackers reportedlybreached hundreds of customer networks using credentials collected from the hacked Bash Uploader. Not long afterwards, HashiCorp disclosed that the Codecov incident led to theexposure of its GPG private keyused to sign and verify software packages. Twilio has also disclosedsome impactfrom the attack, and other companies are stepping forward withsimilar disclosures. The term “midstream” is being loosely applied here to refer to instances of attackers compromising an intermediary software upgrade functionality or CI/CD tool rather than the original upstream source-code base. Last month, Click Studios, makers of the Passwordstate enterprise password manager used by many Fortune 500 companies,notified customersof a supply chain attack. Attackers compromised Passwordstate’s “In-Place Upgrade functionality” to distribute malicious updates to Passwordstate users. The illicit update contained a modified DLL file titled, Moserware.SecretSplitter.dll, a small part of which is shown below: In asecurity advisory, Click Studios stated: “The compromise existed for approximately 28 hours before it was closed down. Only customers that performed In-Place Upgrades between the times stated above are believed to be affected. Manual Upgrades of Passwordstate are not compromised. Affected customers password records may have been harvested.” Unsurprisingly,phishingattacks against Click Studios users soon followed with attackers putting illicit links to anupdated malwareversion in these emails. In addition to having a technical aspect to it (i.e., the upgrade process being tampered with), this supply chain attack had asocial engineeringaspect as well. In the counterfeit update zip file, which is over 300 MB in size, I discovered the attackers had managed to alter the user manuals, help files, and PowerShell build scripts to point to their malicious content distribution network (CDN) server: One of the help manual documents stating the malicious CDN server as the official one A PowerShell install script containing malicious CDN server links The social engineering aspect to this attack also demonstrates another weakness: that humans (especially newer developers or software consumers) may not always suspect links to content distribution networks (CDNs), whether these are suspicious or not. This is because CDNs are legitimately used by software applications and websites to deliver updates, scripts, and other content. Onlinecredit card skimming attackssuch asMagecartare yet another example of this kind of supply chain attack. In some attacks, Amazon CloudFront CDN buckets have beencompromisedto distribute the malicious JavaScript code to a wider number of websites that rely on such CDNs. In 2021, no piece on supply chain attacks can be complete without mentioning dependency confusion, especially because of the simplistic and automated nature of this attack.Dependency confusionattacks work with minimal effort on the attacker’s end and in an automated fashion due to an inherent design weakness found in multiple open-source ecosystems. Put simply, dependency confusion (or namespace confusion) works if your software build uses a private, internally created dependency that does not exist on a public open-source repository. An attacker is able to register a dependency by the same name on a public repository, with a higher version number. Then, very likely, the attacker’s (public) dependency with the higher version number will be pulled into your software build, as opposed to your internal dependency. Illustration of dependency confusion weakness puzzling multiple ecosystems By exploiting this simple weakness across commonly used ecosystems including PyPI, npm and RubyGems, ethical hacker Alex Birsan was able to hack into35 big tech firmsand walk away with over $130,000 in bug bounty rewards. Days following Birsan’s research disclosure, thousands of dependency confusion copycat packages began floodingPyPI,npmand other ecosystems. Although most of these copycats were created by other aspiring bug bounty hunters, some went a step too far bytargetingknown companies in a malicious manner. There are multiple ways to resolve dependency confusion, including registering (reserving) the names of all your private dependencies on public repositories before an attacker does and using automated solutions—such as a software development lifecycle (SDLC) firewall that prevents conflicting dependency names from entering your supply chain. Owners of open-source repositories can adopt a more stringent verification process and enforce namespacing/scoping in place. For example, to post packages under the “CSO” namespace or scope, an open-source repository could verify if the developer uploading a package has rights to do so under the name “CSO.” Java component repository Maven Central employs a simple domain-based verification toverify namespaceownership—a practice that can easily be modeled by other ecosystems. [Full disclosure: Maven Central is maintained by my employer, Sonatype]. Similarly, packages published to theGo package repositoryare named after the URL to their GitHub repository, making dependency confusion attacks much more challenging, if not outright impossible. With an increase in HTTPS websites,SSL/TLScertificates are now ubiquitously present and protect your online communications. A compromise of an SSL certificate’s private key could therefore threaten the secure communication and assurance offered by an end-to-end encrypted connection to the end-users. In January 2021, Mimecast disclosed a certificate used by its customers to establish connection to Microsoft 365 Exchange services had been compromised, potentially impacting communications of about 10% of Mimecast users. While Mimecast did not explicitly confirm whether this was an SSL certificate, this largely appears to be the case, assuspectedby some researchers. While a compromised SSL certificate is problematic, a stolen code-signing certificate (i.e., a compromised private key) can have far wider consequences for software security. Attackers who get their hands on the private code-signing key can potentially sign theirmalwareas an authentic software program or update being shipped by a reputable company. AlthoughStuxnetremains a significant example of a sophisticated attack in which attackers used stolen private keys fromtwo prominent companiesto sign their malicious code as “trusted,” such attacks have flourished before Stuxnet and continue to even years later. This is also why the aforementioned example of HashiCorp’s GPG private key exposure in the Codecov supply chain attack is problematic. Although there is no indication yet that HashiCorp’s compromised key was abused by attackers to sign malware, such an incident was a real possibility until the compromised key wasrevoked. Sonatype recently observed a multi-faceted software supply chain attack that not only relied on the introduction of malicious pull requests to a user’s GitHub project, but also abused GitHub’s CI/CD automation infrastructure, GitHub Actions, to mine cryptocurrency. GitHub Actions provides developers with a way to schedule automated CI/CD tasks for repositories hosted on GitHub. The attack consisted of attackers cloning legitimate GitHub repositories that used GitHub Actions, slightly altering the GitHub Action script in the repository, and filing a pull request for the project owner to merge this change back into the original repository. Attacker (edgarfox1982) filing pull request for a legitimate project owner to merge altered code Should a project owner casually approve the altered pull request, a supply chain attack has succeeded, but that wasn’t even the prerequisite here. The malicious pull request contained modifications to ci.yml, which were automatically run by GitHub Actions as soon as the pull request was filed by the attacker. The modified code essentiallyabuses GitHub’s serversto mine cryptocurrency. Such an attack kills two birds with one stone: It tricks a developer into accepting a malicious pull request, and should that fail, it abuses the automated CI/CD infrastructure in place for conducting malicious activities. Likewise, researchers who successfully breachedUnited Nations (UN) domainsand accessed over 100,000 UNEP staff record could do so mainly because they had found exposed Git folders and “git-credentials” files on these domains. A threat actor who obtains access to Git credentials can not only clone private Git repositories, but potentially introduce malicious code upstream to trigger a supply chain attack which would have much harsher consequences. The primary focus of those looking to prevent supply chain attacks has been on recommending secure coding practices to developers or usingDevSecOpsautomation tools in development environments. However, securing CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins servers), cloud-native containers, and supplementary developer tooling and infrastructure has now become just as important. As any security professional knows, security is only as strong as its weakest link. Because the human element remains the weakest link, exploitation may come from places where it is least expected. The Linux Foundation recentlybannedUniversity of Minnesota researchers who were suggesting intentionally buggy “patches” that in turn introduced vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel source code. Although the instance was caught and has now been dealt with, it demonstrates a few simple facts: Developers are spread thin and may not always have the bandwidth to vet every single code commit or a proposed code change that may be buggy or outright malicious. More importantly, social engineering may come from least suspected sources—in this case seemingly credible university researchers with an “.edu” email address. Another recentexampleincludes how any collaborator contributing to a GitHub project can alter a release even after it is published. Here again, the expectation of a project owner is that most contributors are submitting code and commits to their project in good faith. It takes just one collaborator to go rogue and compromise the security of the supply chain for many. Over the last year, attackers creatingtyposquattingandbrandjackingsoftware packages have repeatedly targeted open-source developers to introduce malicious code in their upstream builds which then propagates to many consumers. All these real-world examples demonstrate different weaknesses, attack vectors, and techniques that threat actors employ in successful supply chain attacks. As these attacks continue to evolve and pose challenges, more innovative solutions and strategies are needed when approaching software security.

More and more organizations areadopting these initiativesto tap into a vast resource of researchers who dedicate their time to finding and examining vulnerabilities that pose a potential threat in the wrong hands. Their incentive is not only the opportunity to secure sometimes hefty sums of money for the safe and responsible disclosure of certain unknown/unsecured exploits but also the chance to gain recognition as discoverers of security weak spots that could have led to substantial data breaches or other incidents. [For the latest bug bounty announcements, see ourupdated tracker of top bug bounties today.] Bug bounty programs are a relatively new and innovative approach in the conventional cybersecurity landscape. They complement other solutions to bring continuous security testing, discovery of real/high-impact security vulnerabilities, and collaboration with an international community of ethical hackers, Fabien Lemarchand, VP of platform and security at online marketplace ManoMano, tells CSO. Lemarchand co-created Hack4Values — a global bug-hunting program for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and nonprofits. “Bug bounty programs are a response to the current challenges facing organizations in the face of cyber threats: lack of security experts, lack of efficiency, lack of understanding of the exponential growth in cyber threats,” he says. There’s no such thing as zero risk, but by engaging with bug bounty schemes, organizations can think like an attacker, rather than a defender, Lemarchand adds. They bring an offensive approach to traditionally defensive cyber strategies that puts people and ethical hacking at the heart of cyber strategies. “Every discovery made by an ethical hacker during a bug bounty program will be real and relevant to your security strategy, as well as the protection of your information systems and their users.” They can provide a clear return on investment too — an understandable resource for developers and other business teams, Lemarchand says. “It is a transparent and clear way of highlighting the value of cybersecurity.” Here are 12 notable programs launched in 2023. In January, the US Department of Defense (DoD)revealed plansto launch the third iteration of its Hack the Pentagon bug bounty program, first unveiled in 2016 and repeated in 2018. A key aim of Hack the Pentagon 3.0 is to unleash white-hat hackers on the government’s Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) Facilities Services Directorate (FSD) Facility Related Controls System (FRCS) network, according to a draft performance work statement. “The overall objective is to obtain support from a pool of innovative information security researchers via crowdsourcing for vulnerability discovery, coordination and disclosure activities and to assess the current cybersecurity posture of the FRCS Network, identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities, and provide recommendations to improve and strengthen the overall security posture,” the statement read. Researchers must be diverse in skillset and able to conduct source code analysis, reverse engineering, and network and system exploitation, it added. In March, anti-malware vendor Malwarebytesannounced it was offeringpayouts of between $50 and $2,000 for confirmed vulnerabilities. Those posing a remote code execution (RCE) risk to Malwarebytes’ web properties or customers running its endpoint protection software, or that could lead to the takeover of AWS cloud infrastructure, would attract the greatest rewards, the firm said. “Now we’re doing so much more than just malware remediation. We’ve forged ahead into the world of cyber protection, privacy, and beyond,” the vendor wrote. “Malwarebytes looks forward to working with the security community to find vulnerabilities in order to keep our businesses and customers safe.” In April, ChatGPT creatorOpenAI launcheda new bug bounty program to support the development of safe and advanced AI. “We invite you to report vulnerabilities, bugs, or security flaws you discover in our systems. By sharing your findings, you will play a crucial role in making our technology safer for everyone,” the company said. OpenAI partnered with leading bug bounty platform Bugcrowd to manage the submission and reward process, which it said is designed to ensure a streamlined experience for all participants. “To incentivize testing and as a token of our appreciation, we will be offering cash rewards based on the severity and impact of the reported issues,” OpenAI wrote. Rewards range from $200 for low-severity findings to up to $20,000 for exceptional discoveries. In May, LayerZero Labs, the team that launched the leading cross-chain messaging protocol LayerZero,announced the launchof a new bug bounty program in partnership with Immunefi, the bug bounty and security services platform for Web3. The pair called the program the “largest in the history” of the software industry and shows a commitment to security as well as the developers and users in the LayerZero ecosystem. LayerZero Labs revealed it would be offering a maximum reward of $15 million for each new vulnerability found by participants who uncover vulnerabilities at the highest severity level. “Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2. This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported,”wrote Immunefi. In June, three political tech organizations — Higher Ground Labs, Trestle Collaborative, and Zinc Collective — opened applications for the third edition of The Good Catch, a bug bounty program dedicated to Democratic tech vendors. The program ran during the 2020 and 2022 election cycles, and this cycle’s program will run up until next year’s US presidential election, Matt Hodges, executive director at Zinc Collective’s Democrat-focused political tech lab,told Axios. Participating tech vendors create an account on Federacy, an online program that manages bug bounty programs for organizations. Each company signed up keeps its program private by default, meaning only vetted researchers will be invited to participate. Participating vendors can also decide to open their bug bounty programs to the entire platform. Once their programs are up and running, vendors receive reports of potentially exploitable security flaws on their systems, which they’ll need to verify on their own. If requested, the program can provide vendors with general advice about how to stand up their security programs and can recommend other consultancy firms to help with more nuanced questions. In June, endpoint security vendorSquareX announceda bug bounty program to invite hackers, security researchers, technologists, and students to hack-test its browser-based cybersecurity product and find security vulnerabilities in it before its launch. To incentivize and reward bug hunters, SquareX offered rewards totalling up to $25,000 for successfully discovered, reported, and qualified vulnerabilities. The program spanned six weeks from June 15, 2023, to July 27, 2023, with hunters encouraged to help battle-test and harden the product. “We invite the global hacker community to participate in this bug bounty program and help us discover vulnerabilities. I hope in doing so, we will be able to launch a world-class cybersecurity product that consumers can use and be fearless online,” said Vivek Ramachandran, founder of SquareX. Upon closure of the program,SquareX saidit witnessed an impressive influx of hunters, particularly from India, the USA, and Germany, who launched thousands of automated scans and targeted attacks on its product. However, even with the incentives in place and the doubling of the prize money, SquareX reported that zero critical bugs were discovered during the process. In August, Swisstronik, the layer-1 network for building regulatory-compliant dApps with enhanced data privacy, announced the launch of itsfirst bug bounty programwith rewards reaching $31,000 per bug. Swisstronik said that participants will help the firm become a secure bridge between the traditional world with its regulatory requirements and the Web3 world with its high privacy and decentralization standards. “As a result, developers can contribute to a more balanced Web3 in which KYC and other user verifications do not result in personal data loss or reliance on centralized parties, and help boost the overall blockchain adoption.” In August, Protect AIannouncedthe launch of the “world’s first” AI and machine learning bug bounty platform, huntr. The firm said the launch enables the cultivation of a robust community of security researchers dedicated to uncovering vulnerabilities and providing remediations within AI/ML packages, libraries, frameworks, and models. “As part of our program, it is important that all contributors receive the recognition they deserve. Once a vulnerability has been fully disclosed, acknowledged by the maintainer, and subsequently patched, we credit all contributors involved for their crucial work in the process,”Protect AI said. The platform hosts monthly contests providing researchers opportunities to showcase their skills and earn rewards. The inaugural contest on the huntr AI/ML bug bounty platform focused on Hugging Face Transformers, presenting a reward of up to $50,000. In July,Hack4Values announcedthe expansion of its free bug-hunting program for NGOs and nonprofits across Europe. First launched in France in 2022, the Hack4Values platform is an online community comprised of ethical hackers and security researchers committed to creating a safer digital world for all NGOs and their beneficiaries. The program offers NGOs and nonprofits a free platform audit to help identify the security risks they face, with the Hack4Values community also providing solutions to help these companies keep their data secure from cyber threats. Since launching, over 50 ethical hackers who have volunteered for Hack4Values have provided bug bounty programs for 10 NGOs including Amnesty International and Action Against Hunger. In September,Yahoo announced a partnershipwith global crowdsourced security firm Intigriti to launch a new public bug bounty program. The program covers Europe and is open to the 75,000 ethical hackers who are registered on the Intigriti platform, along with anyone else who wishes to take part. Payout rates are on a scale that’s proportional to potential impact, Yahoo and Intigriti said. Researchers can earn between $100-$500 for low-ranked vulnerabilities, up to $10,000 for high-rated flaws, and between $10,000-$15,000 for any critical issues discovered. The program also offers ethical hacking teams generous cash rewards for topping the leaderboard in select Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, a move that aims to attract top cybersecurity talent and foster collaboration among ethical hackers. “Expanding our bug bounty program with Intigriti gives us a bigger outreach to the global ethical hacker community. We want to cater to as many people as possible and provide the best service possible to our users,” commented Arjun Govindaraju, technical principal security engineer at Yahoo. Nearly 70 assets are in scope under the program, including Yahoo’s high-value web domains, APIs, and Search services, along with Yahoo Shopping, Yahoo Mail, and media brands Yahoo News, and Yahoo Sports. In September, decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Uniswap initiated a new bug bounty program featuring a four-tier severity scale that is critical, high, medium, and low/informational. Uniswap said it would be offering rewards of up to 2,250,000 USD Coin, depending on the severity of identified bugs and assets at risk, according toThe Crypto Times. The program covers vulnerabilities and bugs in smart contracts that are deployed by Uniswap, which can be found in various GitHub repositories including the Universal Router Contract Code, Permit2 Contract Code, V3 Contract Code, and UniswapX Contract Code. In October,Google announced that it is expandingits bug bounty program to include generative AI-specific security issues. Expanding to reward for attack scenarios specific to generative AI will “incentivize research around AI safety and security, and bring potential issues to light that will ultimately make AI safer for everyone,” said Laurie Richardson, VP of trust and safety, and Royal Hansen, VP of privacy, safety and security engineering at Google. The tech giant also announced it would be expanding its open-source security work to make information about AI supply chain security universally discoverable and verifiable. Google’s engineering team posted alist of AI attack scenariosthat are eligible for rewards. These include prompt attacks, training data extraction, manipulating models, adversarial perturbation, and model theft/exfiltration.

Forget the spam filter: How unique phishing attempts undermine Microsoft email security,https://www.csoonline.com/article/1240792/forget-the-spam-filter-how-unique-phishing-attempts-undermine-microsoft-email-security.html,"Phishing is getting more and more difficult for spam filters to defend against, but for those using Microsoft 365, user education and built-in processes can help you fight back. Attackers target email relentlessly Business action-item phishing Password-reset phishing Countering the phishing threat on Microsoft 365 Related content New phishing campaign uses scareware to steal Apple credentials GitHub accounts targeted with fake security alerts Polyglot files used to spread new backdoor Top 5 ways attackers use generative AI to exploit your systems Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  As the email dropped into my inbox, I could see clearly right away it was aphishing attempt, yet my email defenses clearly didn’t agree — at least not right away. Several hours later I would get an alert that the message had been flagged as malicious and was removed. So why, if Microsoft 365 could determine it was malicious hours after being delivered, couldn’t it be flagged as malicious right from the beginning? The alert posted in the Microsoft 365 console clearly showcased the problem faced by many administrators trying to protect against malicious emails: Title:Some users were receiving large amounts of spam messages from specific senders in Exchange Online.User impact:Users were receiving large amounts of spam messages from specific senders in Exchange Online.More info:This issue only affected a very specific group of organizations, and your tenancy may not have been affected. Mail may have originated from non-legitimate Microsoft domains.Final status:We’ve confirmed via an extended period of monitoring that the issue has been resolved after the implementation of our fix.Scope of impact:Some of your users may have received large amounts of spam messages from potentially fraudulent senders in Exchange Online.Preliminary root cause:Our automated Anti-Spam throttling and blocking services were not properly being triggered due to various reasons in logic. A long-term focus remains on this issue to better understand the cause and methods to address the sources of impact. Clearly, we cannot depend solely on Microsoft 365spam filtersto protect our networks. Spam filters provided by our vendors are being targeted and there are cases in which they simply do not work. Attackers know that email is an access point into our networks, and they are attacking it relentlessly. Only a combination of end-user education and best practices can reduce the risk of unique phishing attacks. But they aren’t just limiting themselves to the traditional styles of email attack sequences — now they are using unique ways to enter into our systems. If your IT teams are not using end-user education as a protection tool, you should be seriously looking into adding it. Attackers are pivoting to using emails that correspond to business needs and flows. For example, I am now seeing a rise inquishing— phishing based on QR codes — that is specifically designed to reset two-factor authentication codes. Attackers know that we are in the process of obtaining new phones and redeploying multifactor applications. The QR codes lead to websites that convince the user to enter their username and password so the attacker can harvest the credentials. The best way to foil them is education — to inform your end users of the exact processes and portals they need to access to reset applications protected by two-factor authentication. Be aware that when phone vendors release new versions, they increase the communication to your user base. It’s critical to make sure users are aware of the process required to move two-factor applications to a new device with clear, actionable information easily located on your website. Another, perhaps more insidious style of phishing attacks is the business action item email. These are written as if there are outstanding action items or new business to be done between the user and the bad actor doing the emailing. For example, in the accounting profession, attackers will email to ask the accountants if they are taking on new clientele and request that they accept copies of prior tax returns and tax documents for review. Instead of a link with the tax documents, the attackers send malicious files meant to obtain access to the computer in question in order to gain deeper access to the system. Again, ensuring that end users know the exact protocol around interacting with potentially new clients and how the firm normally receives new business is the first line of defense against such attacks. For most consulting-style firms, clients are obtained through referrals or connections to another client – that means they are expecting exactly the type of email attackers have learned to spoof. While this process may not be foolproof, it will at least ensure that users are less likely to reach out to these impersonators trying to gain access to our networks. Next up are malicious emails that try to trick users into completing unnecessary password resets on your email systems in a bid to obtain credentials allowing access to your network. Users should be informed of the exact portal and process needed to reset passwords and other self-serve processes. An internal company IT communication portal can be useful in ensuring that end users know exactly the procedure to follow. Fake Dropbox and Docusign links are the basis for vendor-specific scams that use stolen graphics from the companies to gain the appearance of authenticity. Creating messages that look very convincingly like they are from vendors we interact with on a daily basis, these emails are yet another attempt to obtain credentials to our networks. Consider adding two-factor authentication to any site that has a goal of interacting with external clients. Alternatively, consider the policy of only sending and receiving information from sites that are under the control of your firm and not accepting any links from external locations. Even applying all of these methodologies, attackers know that our weakest link is often the humans that our members of our networks. Humans want to help one another, but that helpful attitude will open us up to attacks. In the case of Microsoft 365, consider either adding or reviewing your settings in Microsoft Defender for Office P2. Specifically, you want to have your team enableimpersonation settingsin Microsoft 365. For this setting, you can set a maximum of 350 users to be protected by this setting per policy. If you need more than 350 users, you will need to set up multiple policies. While not ideal, this setting should be mandatory for any high-level executive or anyone in a managerial position. Next, review the phishing levels. Chances are you may have left these settings at the original default. In the case of Microsoft Defender, it’s recommended to set them at 2 or 3. Microsoft The default Office 365 settingswilllet phishing through, so ensure that you review the settings for phishing threshold, user impersonation, and domain impersonation. As was showcased above, don’t overlook end user education. Even if it’s merely alert emails or discussions about what sort of threats are being seen, ensure your end users are made aware of the risks. Often even if you are fully patched, these phishing attacks can gather credentials and gain access to your network. If your email protection provides phishing simulations, run these attacks against your network and see how well your human defenses will withstand the typical attacks that are out there. End-user education should not be overlooked or discounted as an effective means to protect your network. With our vendors often failing to protect us, users are often the only thing between our network’s security and an attacker.

How CISOs can talk effectively about a cyber incident’s toll GitHub accounts targeted with fake security alerts Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  QR codes have become a useful tool in the arsenal of bad actors looking to penetrate barriers to access because they’re easy to incorporate into attacks, difficult to detect and prevent, and good at fooling users into giving up credentials. Fortunately, there are effective steps cyber security pros can take to mitigate this growing attack vector. A precipitous rise in 2023 in QR code phishing campaigns — also known asquishing— is being reported by many industry sources, includingPerception Point,Check Point, andAT&T. It is a significant and growing trend, and although technically it’s little more than an embellishment to the standard phishing model, the technique has several features that merit attention. Quishing works by encoding information, often a malicious link, in the ubiquitous QR code image format. The technical-looking codes often make it easier for employees to fall for the scam and harder for automated systems to detect. As security platforms improve their ability to deal with phishing in general, bad actors are always looking for new ways to bypass defenses. Zero-trust policies and multifactor authentication reduce the effectiveness of phishing campaigns. For the attacker, QR codes bring a number of benefits, including some appreciated by legitimate businesses: they are easy to create and easy to use. It is easy for attackers to use free resources to generate convincing QR code enabled phishing emails, attachments, and websites — a mechanism that can increase the effectiveness of their efforts with minimum effort. QR codes look official and present a convenient and fast option for users easy, making them exceptional bait, and are alsomore difficult for automated systems to detectthan other phishing techniques. Since a QR code is just an image that encodes information, it can be used to reduce the amount of malicious data in an email, thereby making it a less obvious target for spam filters. They’re easy to generate and more effective than URL phishing, says Olesia Klevchuk, director of email protection atBarracuda. “URL scanning and URL rewrite technologies are ineffective against QR code attacks because there is simply no link to scan. Because users have to scan QR codes with their phones, it basically moves these attacks to an entirely new device that is often outside of the company’s security.” From the defender’s point of view, the danger of malicious QR codes exists both within the human element (they have an air of legitimacy and are by design very simple) and the machine element (they obfuscate the actual contents of an email or message, making it harder for systems to detect.) Managing the problem requires several different approaches. Education: Ensure users are aware of the quishing trend and emphasize that QR codes are not an indication of legitimacy. Prevention: Automated systems that filter emails and URLs should be examined and hardened against QR codes. Existing use of QR codes by the enterprise should be examined to make it as hard as possible for attackers to hijack them. Response: Detection and lockout mechanisms should be in place to protect against account compromise. Validation: Incorporate QR code attacks red teaming tests and attack simulations. As technology-oriented professionals, we work towards a technology-oriented solution, but education and awareness play their part. We’ve gotten used to harping on the distrust of emails and confirming through a second channel anything significant. Quishing adds an important element: QR codes are not any kind of indication of legitimacy. The most obvious step in protection — education of employees — is both essential and unreliable. QR codes are frustratingly innocuous and inviting. Security professionals need to get the message out that an email with a QR code is to be treated with the same level of suspicion as any other. It can’t hurt to remind employees not to reuse passwords and especially not between work and personal accounts. Employee education must be accompanied by the hardening of technological defenses. It’s critical to ensure that scanning systems are configured to detect QR codes, unpack them as embeds or attachments, and look for malicious content. This is a front-line defense — QR codes that never make it to the inbox are not a threat. QR codes can be embedded in a number of ways, mostly inline or attached to other documents such as Word files or PDFs. Attackers have been clever about using the smaller footprint of a QR code to fool scanning and security professionals need to verify with vendors that QR codes are a covered vector in their products. Whitelisting/blacklisting of email sender domains is another good practice that can help with phishing in general and quishing in particular. QR codes often initiate cross-device interaction in which a user scans a code with their mobile device. In general, mobile devices may offer a less secure platform and the move can switch the user from one work network to another network. Getting users onto mobile devices has become a go-to tactic for attackers in recent years. QR code attacks put an emphasis on security and policy around cross device interactions. This includes cross-domain security, wherein a user may be using a personal device to scan a company computer or vice versa. There are a number of factors to consider that can impact resilience to quishing attacks, including “keeping tight controls around URL shortening and redirects happening from their domain,” says Mathew Woodyward, principal threat intelligence researcher at Okta. Companies should be “paying attention to what QR codes they put out into the wild and ask themselves, ‘How could someone abuse this link?’’ he says. You can be assured that attackers will use AI to generate convincing quishing emails. This is a case of fighting fire with fire. As Barracuda’s Klevchuk says, “The use of AI and image recognition technology is useful in detecting these attacks. AI-based detection will also look for other signals that can be a sign of a malicious presence, such as senders, image size, content, and placement in a to determine malicious intent.” Machine learning detection is important because it is able to form a broader picture of a given artifact and make predictions about whether it’s malicious or not beyond what a person might be able to foresee. AI can form a general picture of an event and make determinations based on real-world learning. There’s no way to know how you are doing without testing. An organization should be running simulated attacks to explore the response of its employees, technology, and security team. Including QR codes in those simulations is an important step. This type of simulation can also help discover how well the organization responds to a breach, especially with regard to compromised account detection and lockout. Woodward echoes this: “Cybersecurity should be deploying tight controls to prevent account takeovers after login,” says Woodward, “monitoring active credential stuffing attempts and stopping them at the identity-level using breached password detection.” Multifactor authentication can help mitigate the effects of a successful QR code attack by limiting the damage of compromised credentials. Interestingly, QR code phishing emails are often disguised as multifactor verification emails, a point to keep in mind when alerting employees and also when designing such legitimate verification notices. The idea is a simple one. QR codes can be embedded in a variety of ways to encode scannable information, in the case of hackers, usually a phishing URL or a malware download. By automatically triggering the effect, QR codes can reduce the amount of thought a user puts into using them. QR codes offer a low-effort “improvement” for attackers, a kind of asymmetrical warfare. Although many quishing campaigns have been targeted at consumers so far, we know from experience that it will spread to enterprise and government targets, something we arealready seeing.

Why Instagram Threads is a hotbed of risks for businesses,https://www.csoonline.com/article/650763/why-instagram-threads-is-a-hotbed-of-risks-for-businesses.html,"Threads is already a target for fraud and abuse, with several potential security and compliance risks associated with its use for organizations. Domain fraud and brand abuse Malicious URLs and malware downloads Unintentional and malicious data leakage/exposure Shared credentials and account hijacking Data privacy and compliance issues Phishing and vulnerabilities Training, policies, and monitoring are key to secure use of Threads Related content New phishing campaign uses scareware to steal Apple credentials GitHub accounts targeted with fake security alerts Polyglot files used to spread new backdoor Top 5 ways attackers use generative AI to exploit your systems Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Instagram’s Threads platform launched to great fanfare in July with a massive surge of users signing up for the new text-sharing and public conversation service, including businesses using the service as an extension of existing social media and communications programs. Many have seen it as an alternative to Elon Musk’s X — formerly Twitter — platform, which has been roiled by massive layoffs, changes that have infuriated some longtime users, and the appearance that Musk’s free speech mandate has given a renewed voice to white supremacists and other hate groups. Instagram users log into Threads via their Instagram account and can post up to 500 characters as well as links, photos, and videos up to five minutes in length. Meta’s new social network is also considered a direct competitor to Slack, receiving over 10 million in site traffic in its first two weeks, with the app’s global website ranking skyrocketing from 545,741 to 5,813. Demand for and intrigue about Instagram Threads is high. However, Threads is also already proving to be a target for fraud and abuse, with several potential security and compliance risks associated with its use for organizations. Research from CSCfound 428 new domain registrations using the term “threads” between June 26 and July 27, 2023, many of which have some sort of affiliation to existing brands. This points to the need for organizations to monitor their domain activity to determine which registrations on Threads are authorized and authentic, and which are fraudulent and can put their brand at risk of abuse, CSC said. Possible brand infringements can include impersonation and hacks. Veriti said it observed a surge in the creation ofsuspicious domains, with 700 domains related to threads being registered daily. These domains pose a significant risk as they can be used to deceive users, distribute malware, and lure unsuspecting individuals into downloading untrusted versions of the app. “As with any new tool or technology, organizations should take the initiative to learn about its risks and consider the security measures needed before jumping right into more consistent use,” CSC said. In the case of online platforms like Threads, cybercriminals will try to beat you to the punch, so it is crucial for organizations to be aware of their entire domain landscape and take proactive steps to cut off exploits and infringements from the source at the time of registration, CSC wrote. High-profile products draw keen interest from malicious actors, and Threads is no exception, Alexander Applegate, senior threat researcher at DNSFilter, tells CSO. “Threads attracted 100 million users in its first week, displacing ChatGPT to become the fastest application to achieve that mark. During that same week, researchers discovered large numbers of suspicious URLs associated with the tool.” While the threat is not one that is likely to make its way into the Apple Store’s walled garden, many of the links were false downloads for malware, Applegate says. “The remaining links were taking advantage of the low state of security review for the product and looking to capitalize on user trust to perpetrate scams and to deliver malware via posting on the platform.” If employees use Threads for official communication or to share sensitive data, there is a risk that the data could be leaked unintentionally. “Even if they are using it for personal conversations, discussions about company projects, strategies, or internal gossip might slip out,” says Callie Guenther, cyber threat research senior manager at Critical Start. Threads has a feature for sharing one’s location, and if used carelessly by an employee, it could reveal sensitive or strategic business location data. Likewise, content shared on Threads, like any cloud service, is stored in servers managed by the service provider. Even if encrypted, there’s always a concern about how this data could be used or who might gain access, Guenther adds. What’s more, Instagram Direct (and by extension, Threads) doesn’t use end-to-end encryption for messages (like signal or WhatsApp) by default. “This means that the content of messages is potentially accessible by Instagram and anyone who can compromise Instagram’s systems,” Guenther says. Threads is very easy to both download and sign up for, as it integrates seamlessly with a user’s Instagram account when first signing up for the platform. However, this seamless integration could pose security risks, according to ablog from AgileBlue. Instagram, Facebook, and now Threads are all owned by Meta and for many users, each of their Meta accounts share the same login credentials between each of the platforms. “This makes it much easier for malicious actors to access information as gaining access to just one account ultimately gives them access to all Meta accounts,” the blog said. In fact, as of writing, only users with an Instagram account can create a Threads account, so if an individual wants to sign up for Threads, they will first have to create an Instagram account. “If an employee’s Threads account is compromised, malicious actors can impersonate the employee to gather information or spread misinformation within their close circle,” Guenther says. Organizations that are required to maintain certain compliance standards might find it challenging if employees use personal apps such as Threads for work-related matters, Guenther says. The app is unavailable in areas with strict privacy laws, such as the European Union (EU). Countries in the EU are much more heavily regulated when it comes to protecting the privacy of the consumer, but regulatory scrutiny regarding Threads extends to the US and other countries. “Meta, the parent company of Threads, remains under a consent decree imposed by the FTC in 2012, which prohibits ‘unfair or deceptive’ practices in handling user personal information. If the forced linking of Instagram and Threads accounts results in users losing adequate control over their data privacy or necessitates burdensome additional steps to ensure data security, it is possible that this could be deemed a violation of the FTC decree,” read AgileBlue’s posting. This highlights the potential legal implications and the importance of ensuring users’ privacy rights are upheld in the context of using Threads, particularly given that Threads collects more user data than many other social media platforms today. “The obvious initial concern is Meta’s historical track record with data privacy, and Threads is no exception. It demands access to all manners of personal data, including location-tracking information, social networking data, financial data, even when the application is not in use,” Applegate says. Any messaging platform can be used to deliver phishing messages and is susceptible to vulnerabilities. “Employees might receive malicious links or be manipulated into sharing sensitive information,” Guenther says. Undiscovered vulnerabilities (zero-days) might be exploited by attackers and, given that Threads is linked with Instagram, there’s a risk that vulnerabilities or data breaches in one app could potentially affect the other, she adds. Vulnerabilities could also be misused to exploit the permissions Threads asks for (like access to contacts and location) on a device. To help ensure secure use of Threads within a business, Guenther recommends implementing a combination of employee training, policies, and monitoring. “Employees should be aware of the risks related to using personal messaging apps for professional purposes. Policies should outline clear guidelines regarding the use of personal apps on work devices. Monitoring tools should detect unauthorized apps or activities.” Two areas in which Threads shows security promise are the lack of a direct-message function, which should help to some extent with cyberbullying, and the absence of advertising, which removes the threat of malvertising and other ad-based scams, Applegate says. “The initial buzz also seems to have cooled significantly, and the platform has apparently lost about half of its subscribers since early June. With less users comes less interest from threat groups.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS New phishing campaign uses scareware to steal Apple credentials GitHub

Emerging cyber threats in 2023 from AI to quantum to data poisoning,https://www.csoonline.com/article/651125/emerging-cyber-threats-in-2023-from-ai-to-quantum-to-data-poisoning.html,"In cybersecurity’s never-ending cat-and-mouse game with hackers and grifters, the threats are always evolving.

According toMicrosoft Threat Intelligence, the hackers, identified as Midnight Blizzard, used Microsoft 365 tenants owned by small businesses compromised in previous attacks tohost and launch new social engineering attacks. Threats evolve constantly as hackers and grifters gain access to new technologies or come up with new ways to exploit old vulnerabilities. “It’s a cat and mouse game,” says Mark Ruchie, CISO of security firm Entrust. [ Related reading:A new fear for CSOs: The sky is falling] Phishing remains the most common attack, with the2023 Comcast Business Cybersecurity Threat Reportfinding that nine out of 10 attempts to breach its customers’ networks started with a phish. The volume and velocity of attacks have increased, as have the costs incurred by victims, with the2022 Official Cybercrimes Reportfrom Cybersecurity Ventures estimating that the cost of cybercrime will jump from $3 trillion in 2015 to a projected $10.5 trillion in 2025. At the same time, security leaders say they see new takes on standard attack methods — such as the attacks launched by Midnight Blizzard (which has also been identified by the names APT29, Cozy Bear and NOBELIUM) — as well as novel attack strategies. Data poisoning, SEO poisoning and AI-enabled threat actors are among the emerging threats facing CISOs today. “The moment you agree to be a CISO, you agree to get into a race you never win completely, and there are constantly evolving things that you have to have on your screen,” says Andreas Wuchner, field CISO for security company Panaseer and a member of the company’s advisory board. Some of the most notable emerging threats stem from the rapid maturing and proliferation of artificial intelligence, experts say. Security officials have witnessed hackers adopt AI at a pace that rivals — and sometimes surpasses — that of enterprise technology teams. The potential of AI-enabled attacks wasn’t unexpected. According toa 2019 Forrester Research report, 80% of cybersecurity decision-makers expected AI to increase the scale and speed of attacks and 66% expected AI “to conduct attacks that no human could conceive of.” The report further stated that “these attacks will be stealthy and unpredictable in a way that enables them to evade traditional security approaches that rely on rules and signatures and only reference historical attacks.” That’s happening now, some experts say. “AI-enabled cyberattacks are already a threat that organizations are unable to cope with. This security threat will only grow as we witness new advances in AI methodology, and as AI expertise becomes more widely available,” assert the authors ofa December 2022 reportfrom the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency in conjunction with the Helsinki-headquartered cybersecurity company WithSecure. According to that report, hackers are using AI to analyze attack strategies, thereby enhancing their likelihood of success. Hackers are also using AI to heighten the speed, scale and scope of their activities. Cybersecurity leaders point to additional emerging threats posed by AI — and more specifically generative AI. First up is the hackers’ use of gen AI to develop malware. There’s also their use of it to create more phishing and smishing messages with content that accurately mimics the language, tone, and design of legitimate emails. That eliminates the awkward diction or sloppy graphics that often help identify them as malicious messages. As Ruchie says, “The phishing emails today are getting more savvy, but generative AI is sure to ramp that up to a level not seen before.” Kayne McGladrey, a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and field CISO at Hyperproof, has seen the evidence. He worked with one organization whose executives received a contract for review and signature. “Nearly everything looked right,” McGladrey says. The only noticeable mistake was a minor error in the company’s name, which the chief counsel caught. But Gen AI isn’t just boosting the hackers’ speed and sophistication, it’s also expanding their reach, McGladrey says. Hackers can now use gen AI to create phishing campaigns with believable text in nearly any language, including those that have seen fewer attack attempts to date because the language is hard to learn or rarely spoken by non-native speakers. “If nothing else, generative AI does a great job at translating content, so countries that haven’t experienced many phishing attempts so far may soon see more,” McGladrey adds. Others warn that other AI-enabled threats are on the horizon, saying they expect hackers will use deepfakes to mimic individuals — such as high-profile executives and civic leaders (whose voices and images are widely and publicly available for which to train AI models). “It’s definitely something we’re keeping an eye on, but already the possibilities are pretty clear. The technology is getting better and better, making it harder to discern what’s real,” says Ryan Bell, threat intelligence manager at cyber insurance provider Corvus, citing the use ofdeepfake images of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyto pass along disinformation as evidence of the technology’s use for nefarious purposes. Moreover, the Finnish report offered a dire assessment of what’s ahead: “In the near future, fast-paced AI advances will enhance and create a larger range of attack techniques through automation, stealth, social engineering, or information gathering. Therefore, we predict that AI-enabled attacks will become more widespread among less skilled attackers in the next five years. As conventional cyberattacks will become obsolete, AI technologies, skills and tools will become more available and affordable, incentivizing attackers to make use of AI-enabled cyberattacks.” On a related note, some security experts say hackers could use an organization’s own chatbots against them. As is the case with more conventional attack scenarios, attackers could try to hack into the chatbot systems to steal any data within those systems or to use them to access other systems that hold greater value to the bad actors. That, of course, is not particularly novel. What is, though, is the potential for hackers to repurpose compromised chatbots and then use them as conduits to spread malware or perhaps interact with others — customers, employees, or other systems — in nefarious ways, says Matt Landers,a security engineer with security firm OccamSec. Similar warnings recently came from Voyager18, the cyber risk research team, and security software company Vulcan. These researcherspublished a June 2023 advisorydetailing how hackers could use generative AI, including ChatGTP, tospread malicious packages into developers’ environments. Wuchnersays the new threats posed by AI don’t end there. He says organizations could find that errors, vulnerabilities, and malicious code could enter the enterprise as more workers — particularly workers outside IT — use gen AI to write code so they can quickly deploy it for use. “All the studies show how easy it is to create scripts with AI, but trusting these technologies is bringing things into the organization that no one ever thought about,” Wuchner adds. The United States passed theQuantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Actin December 2022, codifying into law a measure aimed at securing federal government systems and data against the quantum-enabled cyberattacks that many expect will happen as quantum computing matures. Several months later, in June 2023,the European Policy Centre urged similar action, calling on European officials to prepare for the advent of quantum cyberattacks — an anticipated event dubbed Q-Day. According to experts, work on quantum computing could advance enough in the next five to 10 years to reach the point where it has the capability of breaking today’s existing cryptographic algorithms — a capability that could make all digital information protected by current encryption protocols vulnerable to cyberattacks. “We know quantum computing will hit us in three to 10 years, but no one really knows what the full impact will be yet,” Ruchie says. Worse still, he says bad actors could use quantum computing or quantum computing paired with AI to “spin out new threats.” Another threat that has emerged is data poisoning, says Rony Thakur, collegiate associate professor at the University of Maryland Global Campus’ School of Cybersecurity and IT. With data poisoning, attackers tamper or corrupt the data used to trainmachine learninganddeep-learningmodels. They can do sousing a variety of techniques. Sometimes also called model poisoning, this attack aims to affect the accuracy of the AI’s decision-making and outputs. As Thakur summarizes: “You can manipulate algorithms by poisoning the data.” He notes that both insider and external bad actors are capable of data poisoning. Moreover, he says many organizations lack the skills to detect such a sophisticated attack. Although organizations have yet to see or report such attacks at any scale, researchers have explored and demonstrated that hackers could, in fact, be capable of such attacks. Others cite an additional “poisoning” threat: search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning, which most commonly involves the manipulation of search engine rankings to redirect users to malicious websites that will install malware on their devices. Info-Tech Research Group called out the SEO poisoning threat in itsJune 2023 Threat Landscape Briefing, calling it a growing threat. A majority of CISOs are anticipating a changing threat landscape: 58% of security leaders expect a different set of cyber risks in the upcoming five years, according to a poll taken by search firm Heidrick & Struggles for its2023 Global Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Survey. CISOs list AI and machine learning as the top themes in most significant cyber risks, with 46% saying as much. CISOs also list geopolitical, attacks, threats, cloud, quantum, and supply chain as other top cyber risk themes. Authors of the Heidrick & Struggles survey noted that respondents offered some thoughts on the topic. For example, one wrote that there will be “a continued arms race for automation.” Another wrote, “As attackers increase [the] attack cycle, respondents must move faster.” A third shared that “Cyber threats [will be] at machine speed, whereas defenses will be at human speed.” The authors added, “Others expressed similar concerns, that skills will not scale from old to new. Still others had more existential fears, citing the ‘dramatic erosion in our ability to discern truth from fiction.’” Security leaders say the best way to prepare for evolving threats and any new ones that might emerge is to follow established best practices while also layering in new technologies and strategies to strengthen defenses and create proactive elements into enterprise security. “It’s taking the fundamentals and applying new techniques where you can to advance [your security posture] and create a defense in depth so you can get to that next level, so you can get to a point where you could detect anything novel,” says Norman Kromberg, CISO of security software company NetSPI. “That approach could give you enough capability to identify that unknown thing.” PODCASTS VIDEOS

Shelter from the storm – lessons learned from the Storm-0558 Microsoft email attacks,https://www.csoonline.com/article/652358/shelter-from-the-storm-lessons-learned-from-the-storm-0558-microsoft-email-attacks.html,"Many bad actors act strike quickly, but there are plenty of attackers who can lurk in systems for a long time before striking. Here’s what a recent attack teaches us about a long defense. Bad actors may already lurk in your network Targeted workstations and servers may need more protection Review log files and retention Reporting may not give you time to investigate Related content Trump shifts cyberattack readiness to state and local governments in wake of info-sharing cuts SpyCloud’s 2025 Identity Exposure Report Reveals the Scale and Hidden Risks of Digital Identity Threats Attack time frames are shrinking rapidly. Here’s how cyber teams can cope The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve probably read or heard about the targeted attacks on US government email that used an access token generated by Microsoft to spoof allowed access. CalledStorm-0558, it involved a China-based threat actor using an acquired Microsoft account consumer key to forge tokens to access OWA and Outlook.com,gaining access to sensitive email accounts. The attackers were discovered thanks to some smart outside investigators and some well-created log files that showcased that someone other than the parties authorized to access the accounts was opening these technology assets with unusual methods. In other words (and in my interpretation of Microsoft’s reporting), rather than opening up email on a desktop client, what gave the attackers away was that they used some different and unusual means of opening the email. Merely not being normal triggered the investigation. Microsoft then found that a consumer-based account signing key was used to forge the necessary corporate credentials. Microsoft soon determined how the attackers acquired the key and what it found revealed that the intrusion might have been prevented with enough foresight (albeit only if you were very forward-thinking about the threat of determined attackers several years ago). In April 2021, a consumer credential signing system suffered a blue screen of death, and the associated crash dump included the signing key information. While normally this credential signing system is on an isolated production network, at some point in time after April of 2021 it was moved to the corporate network to be debugged. When an attacker compromised an engineer’s account to gain access to the network, the crash dump that included these sensitive keys was picked up by the attacker. When I read Microsoft’swriteupof what happened, it makes me wonder if — due to log-retention policies that do not go back as far as an event that happened years ago — the present explanation represents what itthinkshappened, not what it knows with absolute certainty. Without actual log files and forensic evidence to be certain, one ultimately must gather what information exists and infer what occurred. What’s clear is that attackers have started to lay in wait and are taking longer between gaining access and abusing it. Thus, the ability to identify when someone has gained access and make the decision to restore your network back to a point in time before the intrusion may become a physical as well as a technical impossibility. While many organizations and companies do not operate in the same high-profile and target-rich environments as Microsoft and national governments, there are some valuable lessons and considerations for all CISOs in the way the Storm-0558 attacks played out. For any asset or human in your organization that handles any key or sensitive processes in your firm, review several items. First, is the workstation they use hardened? Are only those software and tools absolutely needed on that operating system? In light of the crash dump that revealed sensitive secrets, shouldcrash dumps be disabledcompletely in any sensitive machine? Should you have a dedicated and isolated space for crash analysis and have your staff trained to handle and identify those machines that might hold sensitive secrets? Review the hardware and operating system that these key individuals are using and determine whether they should be on newer equipment with more secure boot features or have more security features enabled that often are gated by a Microsoft E5 license. Follow workstation hardening guidance provided by NIST or theCenter for Internet Securityand ensure additional protections for authentication that would help prevent credential stealing such as hardware tokens, Microsoft Hello, or other biometric improvements are in place. Consider the steps you’ve already taken and whether you need to prioritize any human or asset that you consider a likely target. While it’s difficult to keep log files going back more than a year and to keep those we do have adequately secure, it is essential to review our log file retention policies to take into account that attackers often can and do wait for quite a while before taking action. In the past speed was on the side of the bad actors. The faster they got into a network and did damage or installed ransomware, the better. But targeted attackers often have a different goal in mind — accessing data, information, or secrets is their goal, not causing damage. Where ransomware attacks are often quick and bloody, information attacks can be stealthy and lurk for far longer. Depending on the nature of an organization and what are considered its crown jewels, different logging techniques and recordkeeping lengths can better prepare for defense in the long term. Ideally, every log will be analyzed, every computer examined, and every forensic investigator’s report reviewed before a breach is reported. But the reality of reporting requirements means there may not be time to paint a truly full picture of the attack. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has shortened the length of time a business has to report material cybersecurity incidents and has added requirements that information regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance be provided annually. Starting with annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2023, the new rules mandate that SEC registrants “disclose on the new Item 1.05 of Form 8-K any cybersecurity incident they determine to be material and to describe the material aspects of the incident’s nature, scope, and timing, as well as its material impact or reasonably likely material impact on the registrant.” That report is generally due just four business days after a registrant determines that a cybersecurity incident is material. The disclosure may be delayed if the US Attorney General determines that immediate disclosure would pose a substantial risk to national security or public safety, but that’s not something that can be counted on in every instance. It’s far better to ensure that there is a process, a team, and ideally consultants ready to guide communication in four days or fewer. The bottom line is to consider whether an organization could even start an investigation of a material breach in four days, let alone prepare a report meant for a public location. Prepare a network for the worst sort of attack by assuming the attackers are already in place and waiting for the right time.

What’s a cyber incident response retainer and why do you need one?,https://www.csoonline.com/article/653584/whats-a-cyber-incident-response-retainer-and-why-do-you-need-one.html,"Whether you need to hire a team to respond to any and all cyberattacks or just some hired guns to boost your capabilities, incident response retainers can ensure you’re covered. What is an incident response retainer? Why do businesses need IR retainers? IR retainers can address unique needs The benefits of an IR retainer What is included in an IR retainer? Should companies buy or build incident response capabilities? Should small or large companies get an incident response retainer? Related content Suite 404: Training executives for cyberattack response in a playful way 4 key trends reshaping the SIEM market How to create an effective incident response plan How CISOs can rebuild trust after a security incident Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  With cyberattacks consistently on the rise, companies must be able to respond and act quickly on all threats to reduce the risks and minimize reputational damages and legal consequences. Damage often snowballs due to the delays and mistakes organizations make handling these cyber incidents. That’s because the employees who respond to cyber incidents typically only do so when necessary. However, cyber incidents should ideally be responded to by experts who devote 100% of their time to the endeavor. To bridge security gaps, many organizations hire external providers that offer incident response retainer services rather than retain their own internal incident response teams. An incident response (IR) retainer is a fee paid by a company to an external vendor who agrees to be available in the event of a cybersecurity incident, says Will Sweeney, founder and manager partner of Zaviant Consulting. “This is a surface-level agreement so that when an incident occurs the company will be prepared to help you deal with the incident and prevent it from spreading or getting worse and turning into a larger problem,” he says. Such an agreement between an organization and an incident response service provider sets up the parameters in which the two will work together, says Jess Burn, principal analyst at Forrester Research Inc. A retainer locks in a specific response time when a breach is declared by the organization and it contacts the service provider. This often includes a set amount of time the IR provider will spend on digital forensics and incident response activities during a breach at a set hourly rate, Burn says. “Often this rate is pre-negotiated between an IR provider and the organization’s cyber insurance carrier,” she says. “Companies with cyber insurance policies typically pick an IR service provider from a panel of providers approved by their carriers.” Hours spent responding to an incident that go over the amount included in the retainer may be at a different rate than what the company paid upfront, but this is often also negotiated between the insurance carrier and the IR provider, according to Burn. Unused hours often carry over for a period to the next contract year and can be used for other services, such as incident readiness exercises. Cyber incidents are a matter ofwhen, notif, says William Candrick, director analyst at Gartner. While companies can manage and reduce cyber risks, they can’t prevent cyber incidents outright. Therefore, all organizations must have incident response capabilities. “Most organizations either maintain their own computer security incident response teams and security operations centers or they outsource these capabilities; however, many organizations find that they need additional expertise, capacity, and capabilities on-call during a severe or complex incident,” Candrick says. Effective management of a cyber incident hinges on three main factors: having qualified professionals, well-defined operational processes, and appropriate technologies in place when the incident occurs, says Shmulik Yehezkel, chief critical cyber operations officer at CYE, a cybersecurity startup in Tel Aviv. “Without an incident response retainer service contract, complications arise,” he says. “Finding a proficient IR team on short notice can be challenging, and even if these experts are available, they may not possess the specific knowledge required for the incident at hand.” In addition, each organization has its unique processes and assets, meaning it will take some time for IR teams to become familiar with operational complexities, which could lead to potential errors, Yehezkel says. And since IR teams rely on a variety of technological tools, they may encounter obstacles when they deploy these tools because of such factors as network architecture or existing security measures. As such, businesses need to select their IR providers — from their carriers’ panels if they’re insured — as soon as possible, according to Burn. “Don’t wait until you’re under attack to select one,” she says. “The benefit of a retainer is the onboarding process with the IR service provider. Often this provider holds several intake sessions to get to know the organization’s environment (are they cloud, on-prem, or hybrid, for example), their security tech stack, and the skills and competencies of the organization’s internal security team.” The IR provider, the company, and the company’s outside counsel also typically draft and refine a three-party agreement in advance to ensure an IR provider works at the direction of outside counsel during the breach to protect attorney-client privilege, according to Burn. “All of this greatly increases the efficacy of the provider during a breach,” she says. Cybersecurity leaders face a global talent shortage, says Candrick. Simply put, there isn’t enough qualified cybersecurity talent to fill current demand. “Therefore, incident response retainers are one way to quickly augment the in-house cybersecurity team or outsourced managed security service provider when advanced capabilities and additional headcount is needed during a severe or complex incident,” he says. In addition, cyber insurance policies typically require a cybersecurity incident response retainer, among other requirements. So, organizations that are looking for cyber insurance policies or already have such policies in place will likely need to have a retainer to comply with those policies, according to Candrick. In fact, many insurers maintain their own panels of preferred retainer services, breach coaches, and other services. Additionally, incident response retainers enable companies to better manage costs, says Javier Dominguez, CISO at Commvault, a provider of enterprise data protection software. “You gain the benefit from having a pre-negotiated hourly rate and allocated budget should you need to exercise the retainer,” he says. “Not having [an incident response retainer] will place you at a disadvantage to negotiate and budget appropriately.” According to Kayne McGladrey, IEEE senior member and field CISO at Hyperproof, a provider of automated performance management software, an incident response retainer typically consists of the following elements: A comprehensive strategy for incident response that decreases the likelihood and financial impact of a data breach. Round-the-clock access to experts in incident response. Established communication channels and response playbooks to expedite recovery. Plan development and testing for managing incidents, along with creating a playbook. Support for remediation, crisis management, and communication after a breach occurs. Forensic tools for quickly addressing and reducing the impact of specific cyber threats. Training programs to boost an organization’s ability to detect and prioritize threats and minimize the time an attacker remains undetected. There are many operating models in this space, says Bryan Willett, CISO at Lexmark. “An organization could decide to completely outsource their entire security practice and incident response would be included,” he says. “Or a company may deem that it is important for them to own the responsibility of managing cybersecurity risk within their organization. In this case, they will need to assess their response maturity and augment appropriately.” There are only a few organizations in the world with all the expertise necessary to respond to a significant cyber incident, Willett adds. Even so, it is important for them to consider the potential legal liability associated with any incident and bring in third parties to collect the appropriate evidence in the event there is litigation surrounding an event. “When considering this, it is important to work closely with your legal team and cyber insurance carrier to ensure that you’re taking the right steps to satisfy your insurance carrier’s claim requirements,” he says. Determining whether an organization should build or buy incident response capabilities depends on the company, as small organizations most likely won’t have the budget and headcount that would allow them to retain skilled incident response experts on staff, says Brandon Leiker, principal solutions architect, security at 11:11 Systems, a managed infrastructure solutions provider. Additionally, they likely wouldn’t have situations occurring frequently enough to allow incident response experts to maintain their skill sets. Larger organizations, however, may have the budgets and employees to allow them to retain incident response experts on staff, according to Leiker. They may also have the frequency of cyber incidents that would allow for employees with those skills to maintain and continue to hone their abilities. Those internal employees would likely be able to appropriately address small to medium cyber incidents, but they still may need additional assistance to handle very large and serious cyber incidents, he says. “[However], Incident response retainers can be a vital part of your organization’s incident response strategy regardless of whether you’re a small organization without the resources to build out incident response capabilities internally or a large organization that needs to augment its incident response capabilities,” Leiker says.

Under the cloak of anonymity, cybercriminals and threat actors can operate, selling an array of tools and services that can be used to wreak havoc on organizations. There’s a lot for CISOs to come to grips with and here are 10 things to be aware of when navigating the dark web. The number and variety of cybercrime services available on the dark web are growing, according to Ivan Shefrin, cybersecurity expert at Comcast Business. This includes botnets, easy-to-deploy commodities, stolen credentials, simple exploits and sophisticated exploits such as access to privileged systems like Active Directory and unpublished zero-day exploits. Botnets are cheap and easy to use, so they continue to be among the most common cybercrime commodities sold on the dark web. “These large networks of compromised computers and IoT devices can be used for a variety of malicious cyber activities, including DDoS attacks, e-commerce click fraud, ransomware and crypto mining. Since it’s become relatively easy to repurpose bots across different types of attack vectors, this has led to the creation of a botnet black market,” Shefrin says. Stolen credentials have replaced exploits as the most common method of gaining initial access to internal environments, impacting what’s in demand on the dark web. “Among the most sought-after are valid credentials for remote desktop access, which saw a large increase during the COVID-19 pandemic,” says Shefrin. “The dark web is everyone’s go-to source for gaining initial access to victims’ networks.” There’s a whole ecosystem on the dark web for the sale of vulnerabilities and exploits against corporate systems, many of them invitation-only, according to Gareth Owenson, an experienced dark web researcher and Searchlight Cyber CTO. The way it works is that criminals undertake some reconnaissance on the clients and the target network and will know what systems and networks they’re running when they turn to the dark web. “They go on to these marketplaces looking for vulnerabilities for those particular systems. And when they find them, they pay a price for an exploit which works against that vulnerability,” says Owenson. A supply chain exists for designing attacks against corporate networks, where criminals will buy different services and technical goods from other actors, some of which are individuals and others are serious, organized criminal groups on the dark web. “The actors behind an attack may not access the organization’s network directly themselves. They may pay someone else to do that because that person has bought a vulnerability on the dark web to gain the access,” he says. Knowing the right people or paying for access is usually the most common way to gain access to invite-only forums, according to Ryan Estes, intrusion analyst at WatchGuard Technologies. “You could also build trust with members of these groups or forums, but that is usually something that law enforcement officials acting undercover do,” he says. Rennie Westcott, Intelligence Analyst with Blackbird AI says access to invite-only places is typically done through third-party data providers. “Most organizations will not have a risk tolerance that permits employees to access invite-only deep and dark web forums.” However, experienced professionals at organizations with a high-risk tolerance can certainly see benefits through trawling deep web forums for things like exposed credentials and TTPs relevant to their organization’s security infrastructure. “Researchers will typically create fake personas tailored to the site they’re looking to access—this is where language skills and the ability to assimilate into fringe communities are essential,” he adds. Law enforcement may infiltrate groups and pull together enough detail to identify the group running the site or group members may make a mistake and accidentally post their email address in the real world and be identified and arrested. However, one of the challenges for law enforcement in taking out these groups is that they rotate their infrastructure. A recent law enforcement crackdown saw a coordinated takedown of many, many servers because if they miss one single server, the whole thing stays running, says Owenson.  “So, if all enforcement goes after one server, they’ve got servers all over the world that automatically fill in and replace when those servers are taken down,” he says. Law enforcement agencies in many countries, including the Australian Federal Police (AFP), are actively policing the dark web through sophisticated techniques, targeted operations and new policing powers such as network activity and data disruption warrants. They target the illicit sale of personal data, malware and cybercrime tool development and sales, as well as ‘cybercrime-as-a-service’. “The goal is to identify, disrupt and prosecute cybercriminals domestically, and through international law enforcement partnerships,” an AFP spokesperson says. “Joint domestic and international law enforcement actions have led to significant arrests and seizures of criminal assets and illicit funds and have enhanced the safety and security of the online environment for Australians,” the spokesperson says. Some of the major operations include thetakedown of Genesis Marketthat offered stolen credentials and access to compromised devices, and the shutdown of ‘DarkMarket,’ which had almost 500,000 users, more than 2,400 sellers and more than 320,000 transactions. Law enforcement agencies will also need to respond to major breaches with dedicated task forces to monitor and minimize the misuse of sensitive and personally identifiable information (PII). Another example isOperation Guardian, delivered in partnership with state and territory police and the Australian Cyber Security Centre, which was established after major Australian breaches toOptus,Medibankand Latitude. “Operation Guardian works to disrupt criminal conduct, including the potential sale of PII on the dark web, and prosecute those responsible,” the spokesperson says. Maybe not everything, but just about everything is available in the way of illicit and illegal goods including drugs, firearms, and poisons as well as exploits, vulnerabilities, access, tools, techniques and stolen data are commodities sold on the dark web. Data is the most common commodity sold on the dark web, according to Nirmit Biswas, senior research analyst at Market Research Future. “Account credentials, credit card information, addresses and social security numbers have all been hacked. Someone might not even realize they’ve been hacked, yet their company and employee information could be sold,” Biswas says. According to thePrivacy Affairs Dark Web Price Index, attackers can make a lot of money from stolen personal information on anything from credit cards to Netflix accounts. Currently, the going rate for stolen credit card information with a balance of up to $1,000 is only $70, while cards with a balance of up to $5,000 cost $110. “The index shows how cheap it is to get data on the dark web,” says Biswas. What was once a small, unknown area of the internet has grown into a formidable power, according to Biswas, and attackers are innovating to stay ahead of defenders in the cat-and-mouse game. It’s become more diversified and more comprehensive, and one area that is seeing growing interest is ransomware attacks that are spurring criminal activity on the dark web. Cybercriminal syndicates will publish the stolen data if a ransom isn’t paid. They will also make it easier for other criminals to search that data for staff and customer emails. This is intended to increase the reputational harm to an organization, thereby increasing the possibility they will pay the ransom. “And because ransomware material is so popular, hackers are taking photographs from ransomware collections and botnet log files and publishing them in the hopes of increasing their reputation and renown,” Biswas says. Many marketplace sellers also provide zero-day exploits that have yet to be found or publicized. “In other cases, when companies reveal software vulnerabilities, the operational exploits become accessible on darknet forums and markets,” he says. Another area on the up is marketing lead databases, which have been available on the dark web for some time, but the aggregate amount has increased dramatically in recent years, according to Biswas. Although the data may be publicly available on social media or in business directories, it’s scraped and reposted. And it may not even be 100% accurate. “But it still exposes a vast number of individuals to phishing scams, corporate fraud, and social engineering,” he says. Data breach standardization is becoming the norm, explains Sarah Boutboul, intelligence analyst at Blackbird AI, helping bad actors engage in more targeted searches for the particular information they’re seeking on the dark web. It means that data breach activity has become more organized in hacking forums, chat apps, and paste sites. “Threat actors increasingly request and share data that fit specific categories, leading to a more structured landscape for illicit data trading,” Boutboul says. Not surprisingly, the dark web also sells the technical tools and information to set up another dark web. “There are many dark webs already,” says Douglas Lubhan, VP of threat intelligence at BlackFog. “Basically, any network that is shielded from internet search engines and restricts access to it is a dark web. You could layer upon layer if you choose to,” he says. The number of users across relays has increased in 2023, and the number of relays themselves has increased, according toTor metrics, suggesting dark web usage is on the rise. There are a few well-known forums offering vulnerability and exploit auctioning, bartering or selling, according to WatchGuard’s Estes, which include the Russian Anonymous Marketplace (RAMP), exploit[.]in and xss[.]is. Estes says these forums are also vectors for recruitment efforts by ransomware groups and offer hacking tips for sale. “In some cases, users will sell access information to organizations in what are called IABs (initial access brokers). The dark web is a hodgepodge of cybercriminal commerce,” he says. And there are new domains coming online all the time. “We observe a handful of new ransomware double extortion pages a month; in some cases, these are rebrands of previously known ransomware groups. So, as some websites go down, others arise (rebrand). The volume of dark web domains has remained stagnant, even though the overall traffic has increased recently,” Estes says. Estes agrees that there are legitimate purposes for using anonymizing tools like Tor. In some cases, some organizations create both a clear web and a dark web domain. “The most obvious reason for this is to allow users who don’t use Tor to access their website,” says Estes, citing FBI and X (formerly Twitter) as two examples. In terms of malicious sites, there have been cases where a ransomware group creates a typo-squatted domain or dark web domain that mirrors a victim’s website. “They then provide instructions or more blackmail attempts to further coerce victims into paying. ALPHV/BlackCat and Lorenz are examples of these,” Estes says. Some of the legitimate uses of anonymizing technology like Tor, include when journalists, activists and others need to host content anonymously and protect their communications from governments or oppressive regimes. Owenson acknowledges Tor has legitimate uses for privacy and circumventing censorship; however,his researchsuggests the vast majority of activity is criminal in nature. Owenson believes the problem is that those who run the Tor network, despite hosting illicit activities, do not actively police sites due to its ideological commitment to anonymity. “They’ve expressed that they have no interest in censoring any part of the dark web.” The dark web is increasingly becoming corporate in various areas, such as hacking, recruitment and technology services. Cybercriminals will create look-a-like mobile applications, websites and social media profiles of executives and companies that appear exactly like the real thing. “It could be a banking app that looks like your bank but isn’t. If you download it or visit a site and submit your username and password, you will be impacted. If it’s a fake social media profile, cybercriminals may share manipulated information that impacts the company brand and stock price,” says Blackbird AI’s Boutboul. In addition, dark web forums are adopting enterprise-style stricter access controls due to heightened law enforcement actions. “Admins scrutinize newcomers more carefully, demanding references and verification tokens. Some platforms require significant cryptocurrency payments upfront,” Boutboul says. “Cybercriminals are responding to increased law enforcement activities by enhancing their own security measures.” There are a range oftools and services that scan the dark weblooking for organizational threats and vulnerabilities but it’s a constantly moving target. “Dark web surveillance is a constantly changing field that requires continual updates and tweaks to stay successful,” Biswas says. An effective dark web monitoring system should provide broad visibility into the dark web without having to enter it. “This keeps admin users from placing themselves in danger or being exposed to provocative content. Keywords relevant to your organization should be highlighted by the solutions. You may then watch the threat as it evolves in order to respond accordingly,” he says. “There is no one dark web monitoring solution for all use cases; some are entirely automated, others require a team of specialists to manage, and some rely on machine learning and artificial intelligence to give accurate and relevant information,” Biswas says.

How CISOs can talk effectively about a cyber incident’s toll Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Shawn P. Murray knows firsthand the importance of puttingthreat intelligenceto good use. Murray was advising a defense contractor for the US government when information from a threat intelligence report raised a red flag. Based on the data, Murray ferreted out a problem in the company’s supply chain, identifying that a potential new vendor that purported to be Canadian was actually headquartered in Russia and linked to organized crime. The intel further indicated that any data shared with that vendor would ultimately end up in Russian servers. “Through threat intel we were able to thwart a significant issue,” says Murray, now president and chief academic officer at Murray Security Services and president of the Information Systems Security Association’s international board of directors. Although Murray’s experience may be unique, the value he puts on threat intel is not. Many CISOs have been using threat intelligence — or more specifically cyber threat intel — for years, recognizing that the additional data about the threat landscape can help them better prepare for and defend against bad actors. However, a significant percentage of CISOs say they’re falling short in their use of threat intelligence. ASearchlight Cyber March 2023 reportfound that 93% of CISOs polled are concerned about dark web threats, but 21% of CISOs have no threat intelligence capability at all. And an Enterprise Strategy Group’s March 2023 report noted that 46% of CISOs do not consume cyber threat intelligence reports on a regular basis. Those figures, security leaders say, only provide a glimpse at what’s going on. They say the real issue isn’t whether CISOs have access to or even receive intelligence, stressing that nearly all security teams have some threat intel built into the security tools and services that are now standard in all organizations. Rather, the question is whether CISOs are effective in using the threat intel they do receive and to what degree they can operationalize the intelligence. “That’s where we see issues — around the effectiveness of threat intelligence use,” says Kevin Urbanowicz, leader for the Cyber Detect & Respond advisory solution area in Deloitte’s Cyber & Strategic Risk practice. “That operationalizing is an area where there is a gap in some organizations, and it’s an unfortunate missing piece of the puzzle as organizations seek to get to the next level [in their security program].” CISOs, like all executives, take information from a multitude of sources to help them make decisions and formulate plans. Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is simply one piece of that information stream, but it has some unique qualities and value, according to security leaders. “Cyber threat intelligence is timely, accurate and relevant information on cyber threats that CISOs can use to evaluate their internal priorities and focus efforts around relevant risks,” says David Sandell, CEO of CI-ISAC Australia, an information sharing and analysis center serving the country’s critical infrastructure sector. “There are a lot of misnomers around what is and isn’t threat intelligence,” Sandell adds, noting that “the majority of information sold or gathered as ‘intelligence’ is in fact data or information. To be classified as intelligence, the information needs to be augmented with context (the ‘so what?’) so that it can be effectively used to manage risk.” As Sandell explains, not every threat is a risk. Thus, CISOs need situational awareness of the various threats so they can assess them in relation to their environment and their security controls. That then tells them what their residual risks or exposure are. “This then informs how they prioritize response efforts,” Sandell says. “Threat intelligence enables teams to assess relevant threats to their organization and, to the points above, make informed decisions on what needs to be done. Context is key to usable threat intelligence — What’s the threat? How does it eventuate? How complex is it to enact? Who is responsible? Am I likely to be targeted? Am I vulnerable?” Sandell says that without an understanding of threats, cyber teams rely on reactive, assurance-based security controls, “having access to quality threat intelligence allows them to proactively remediate any security control gaps — hopefully before the threats eventuate in their environment.” CTI comes to CISOs from various channels; some intel is free, and much of it is fee-based. Although some CISOs have the resources to gather their own threat intel, most obtain it from government agencies, researchers, and ISACs. CISOs also buy threat intelligence from commercial cybersecurity companies; vendors provide that intel through feeds and reports and/or through automated updates to the technologies and services they sell to security teams. Experienced CISOs, security researchers and other security leaders say the availability of and access to threat intel aren’t issues — nor are they the reasons behind the survey findings indicating no or limited threat intel within some organizations. The real issue, experts say, lies in whether and how well security teams can operationalize threat intel. The use of threat intel happens in three ways, says Forrester principal analyst Brian Wrozek. The first is tactical, a use that’s often automated. For example, security tools that block dangerous IP addresses are automatically updated as the tool makers get intel about new addresses deemed problematic. The second is operational, a step up on the security maturity scale, where CISOs and their teams are using intel to inform their incident responses. For example, intel can inform a team about what next steps to expect if they see a certain type of threat within their environment. The third is strategic, which is the most sophisticated use of threat intel. This is where CISOs integrate intel with the threat landscape, their IT environment, their organization and their industry to shape strategic decisions within the security function and for the organization overall. It’s in those second two areas where many CISOs aren’t yet effectively using threat intel. “Threat intel is not part of the everyday operations of CISOs,” says Sergio Tenreiro de Magalhaes, chief learning officer at Champlain College Online and an associate professor of cybersecurity and digital forensics. Yet it’s in these two areas that threat intel can deliver significant advantages, as threat intelligence enables organizations to more accurately prioritize their limited security resources, better prepare their defenses and make smarter decisions about where to go next. Urbanowicz says such applications of threat intel are essential for creating a “threat-informed defense.” “CISOs have to prioritize on what matters most to them, their sector and their industry, because there’s not a budget to do all things or cover all bases,” he says, explaining that threat intel gives CISOs the perspectives needed to do that. “We want to look at trends, which direction are threat actors moving in, what are those trends telling us about the future, and how all those things that a threat actor is doing informs us about what we need to be doing.” Jason Rader, vice president and CISO of Insight and a former executive with RSA, the security division of EMC, says threat intel allowed his team to prevent any potential incidents following the disclosure of critical vulnerabilities within Apache Log4j. He says having a team that has operationalized the use of threat intel “is almost the definition of going from reactive to proactive; it’s about preventing the fires, not just fighting them.” Others agree with that assessment. “While not using threat intelligence doesn’t guarantee a security incident, it can leave an organization less prepared and more vulnerable to cyber threats,” adds Bryon Hundley, vice president of intelligence operations with the Retail & Hospitality ISAC. “The consequences of not using threat intelligence can include a lack of visibility into emerging threats, slower detection and response, ineffective incident response, compliance risk, and financial loss. Also, threat actors use their own form of threat intelligence so it’s in the best interest of organizations to do the same.” Like much in security, making effective use of threat intel at all three tiers — tactical, operational, and strategic — is easier said than done, with veteran security leaders saying CISOs typically face myriad challenges in their efforts on this front. As is often the case in cybersecurity, challenges in getting the right talent for this task are a top barrier to success, Urbanowicz says. CISOs generally focus on hiring technically competent workers, and in most cases, that approach works. However optimizing the value of threat intel requires analytical skills and situational awareness — skills that enable security teams to turn data into actionable items. “Threat intelligence is a little bit more of a qualitative state; it requires a more analytical mindset — and [workers with that mindset] are not the first ones to be hired,” Urbanowicz says. That security talent also needs enough insights into the organization’s IT environment, business operations, strategy and sector, too. Those insights allow the intel analysts to, first, identify what threat intelligence feeds and reports matter most to the organization and, second, home in on the data within those intelligence reports that’s most meaningful for the organization and its unique security posture. The security team then needs to know what to do with those nuggets of intelligence — whether that means fine-tuning a security event and information management (SEIM) system, investing in new tools that better target the identified threats or adjusting business strategy in response to a changing threat landscape. Tenreiro de Magalhaes says CISOs often face an overarching barrier as they try to tackle these other challenges: that is, getting the funding required to purchase the intelligence reports and to pay for the staff required to make use of the intelligence. “Cyber teams are generally flat out trying to keep an organization safe and respond to ongoing operational demands, [so] it’s very easy for a task like this to get deprioritized,” Sandell adds. But that de-prioritization may not be an option much longer, says Wrozek, the Forrester analyst, explaining that the effective use of threat intel “is becoming more and more a requirement for your security program.” A majority of CISOs are boosting their threat intelligence capabilities this year, withForrester Research reportingthat nearly two-thirds of surveyed security decision-makers increased their spending on such technologies from 2022 to 2023. Forrester also found in its 2022 Security Survey that 22% of security technology decision-makers identified improving threat intelligence capabilities as a top tactical IT security priority — making it No. 3 on the list of top IT security tactical priorities. “There are so many threats out there. How do you make sense of it all? How do you prioritize?” Wrozek says. “You prioritize and you improve decision-making based on intel.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS CISOs are taking on ever more responsibilities and functional roles - has it gone too far?

The rise of AIT scams: how fraudsters are undermining text passcodes,https://www.csoonline.com/article/646950/the-rise-of-ait-scams-how-fraudsters-are-undermining-text-passcodes.html,"Artificial inflation of traffic scams are on the rise, siphoning revenue away from companies almost imperceptibly. Awareness of how they work and taking the proper precautions can help defend against them. Why there is an increase in AIT fraud? What is the impact of AIT fraud? Why CISOs should care about AIT fraud Awareness is the first step in combatting AIT scams Best practices for reducing SMS AIT fraud Related content Governments won’t like this: encrypted messaging between Android and iOS devices coming, says GSMA Russian cyberespionage groups target Signal users with fake group invites Microsoft secretly stopped actors from snooping on your MFA codes From MFA mandates to locked-down devices, Microsoft posts a year of SFI milestones at Ignite Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  As if there weren’t enough issues for CISOs and other senior security leaders to contend with, from intrusions to vulnerabilities to ransomware, another threat is lurking that is virtually invisible, can damage a company’s reputation, break customer trust, and quietly siphon away revenue — the artificial inflation of traffic (AIT) scam. Also known as SMS traffic-pumping scams, AITs are a form of cybercrime in which cybercriminals identify targets with a non- or low-protected phone number input field that distributes one-time passcodes (OTPs), app download links, or other content via text messages. They’re insidious and they’re on the rise. Here’s how they work, according to Roger Albrecht, partner and co-leader of cybersecurity with global technology research and advisory firm ISG: A cybercriminal develops a bot designed to create fake accounts on a web service or app. The cybercriminal collaborates with a rogue party to intercept the artificially inflated traffic without delivering the messages to their intended recipients. A small mobile network operator (MNO) might be a collaborator as a rogue party. The bot triggers the delivery of one-time passcode SMS messages to various mobile numbers. The rogue party suppresses the delivery of the content. The cybercriminal and the rogue party share the generated revenues and continue the cycle to further inflate revenues or manipulate conversion statistics, enhancing their illicit gains. “What makes AIT scams challenging is that they can be hard to detect and prevent, as they often involve sophisticated techniques to mimic real user behavior,” says Nigel Gibbons, director and senior advisor at security consulting firm NCC Group. “They also pose a significant financial threat to advertisers, content providers, and telecoms that may end up paying significantly for worthless traffic or engagement.” Many factors are contributing to an increase in AIT scams. The most basic driver is the potential for financial gain, Gibbons says. Whether it’s through inflated ad revenues, increased inter-carrier compensation, or higher fees for influencers, the potential rewards for successful AIT scams can be substantial. And the escalating costs of application-to-person (A2P) SMS services have made the profit potential of AIT scams increasingly enticing to cybercriminals, Albrecht says. “Some cybercriminals even utilize the proceeds from AIT schemes to fund legitimate SMS traffic, leveraging the profitability of AIT to offset costs.” The development of more sophisticated bots and software makes it easier for fraudsters to mimic real user behavior and avoid detection, Gibbons says. And these systems are being commercialized as software-as-a-service solutions and made available to non-technical users and traditional organized crime gangs. Additionally, AIT fraud presents difficulties in identification due to its lack of regulation within common SMS agreements and regulatory frameworks, Albrecht says. “This allows AIT to circumvent MNO’s firewalls, as one-time passcodes used in AIT scams are not typically flagged as spam or prohibited content.” AIT scams can lead to financial losses for app developers who unwittingly facilitate fraudulent activity. Increased traffic from the scam can result in inflated costs for SMS services or revenue-sharing agreements, impacting the app’s profitability, says Albrecht. In February, Elon Muskclaimed Twitter lost $60 million a yeardue to AIT-based scams. Consequently, Twitter removed two-factor authentication (2FA) via text because of these attacks, except for verified Twitter Blue users, to save money by limiting 2FA SMS use to subscription customers only. AIT is a problem for businesses because it raises the A2P costs at the expense of the enterprise, says Lee Suker, head of authentication and number information at Stockholm-based Sinch. Not only that but sending too many one-time passcodes to consumers drives mistrust and can ultimately reflect poorly on a company’s reputation. In addition, cybercriminals exploit the infrastructure provided by MNOs to carry out their fraudulent activities, resulting in revenue being shared with the cybercriminals, according to Albrecht. As SMS rates continue to rise, businesses may seek alternative authentication methods, reducing the demand for A2P SMS services and causing revenue loss for MNOs. AIT scams can also have a detrimental effect on the reputation of businesses, Albrecht says. When users receive multiple OTPs that they didn’t request, it raises doubts about the legitimacy and compliance of the organizations involved. “This can lead to a loss of trust from customers who may question the integrity of the affected apps and the MNOs associated with the fraudulent activities,” Albrecht says. “The negative perception and potential negative publicity resulting from such scams can cause a decline in user confidence and adversely impact the reputation of the businesses involved.” While it may not represent a direct attack or intrusion into a system or network, AIT fraud impacts not just the marketing department or the bottom line but an entire organization. That means it’s important for CISOs and chief security officers CSOs to be vigilant for the signs of AIT fraud because they play vital roles in protecting their organizations’ information and assets, Gibbons says. “AIT is a direct threat to these responsibilities and can have serious consequences,” Gibbons says. “As such, it’s something that should be on the radar of every CISO and CSO because [these attacks] can have a financial impact on your company, increase reputational and security risks, and affect data integrity, regulatory compliance and customer relationships and trust. Given these reasons, it’s clear that AIT fraud falls within the purview of CISOs and CSOs.” Not only can AIT scams result in significant financial losses for an organization, but they can also interfere with compliance with data privacy and security laws, says Avani Desai, CEO of Schellman, a cybersecurity assessment firm. “As the CISO is responsible for managing and mitigating financial risks related to cybersecurity, this becomes a risk they need to mitigate,” she says. And to ensure the integrity of SMS communications and protect against AIT scams, CISOs and CSOs should prioritize the security of their companies’ mobile channels by implementing strong controls, monitoring systems, and user verification processes, according to Albrecht. And they need to improve the collaboration with app developers and MNOs to share information, best practices, and countermeasures to combat AIT scams collectively. “By staying informed about emerging threats, such as AIT scams, CISOs and CSOs can proactively assess risks, implement appropriate controls, and allocate resources to mitigate the financial and reputational impacts of these scams,” Albrecht says. Mandy Andress, chief information security officer at Elastic NV, agrees that CISOs should be concerned about these types of scams. Traffic pumping isn’t taking advantage of a security flaw, per se, but it is concerned with taking advantage of how easy it is to create new accounts, she says. And attackers could leverage that process for different types of malicious activities, depending on the service availability. “From a security perspective, the focus would be on the authentication and the new account creation process and not relying solely on SMS — which has been proven to be the most insecure — and instead use multifactor authentication or other approaches,” Andress says. “This would take away the ability for this type of scam to be successful and at the same time help to improve the security for your customers in their accounts.” This is often a complex process that requires a multifaceted approach that involves detection, prevention, and response strategies, Gibbons says. No single strategy is completely foolproof — the key is to build a strong, multilayered defense that includes: Regular audits:Companies should conduct regular audits of their mobile traffic and advertising campaigns and look for any inconsistencies or irregularities in their data. Skills and awareness:Ensure that teams understand the risks and signs of AIT scams. An educated team is better equipped to spot potential fraud and take action. User behavior analysis:Understand the behavior of legitimate users to better spot when something is out of the ordinary. This will help distinguish between genuine and fraudulent traffic. The challenge for businesses here is their maturity, as few have this granular level of certainty. Trustworthy ad networks:For businesses engaged in digital advertising, it’s crucial to partner with ad networks known for taking proactive measures against fraud. These networks have strong systems in place to identify and mitigate AIT scams. Yale Fox, a member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, offers these best practices to mitigate mobile SMS AIT fraud: Blocking bots: Bots are often used in fraudulent activities to mimic human behavior and generate fake traffic. Blocking bots by default, particularly those that do not identify themselves, can effectively reduce fraudulent traffic. Organizations should maintain lists of user-agents that are allowed to crawl their sites and actively update those lists as new, legitimate bots emerge. reCAPTCHAv2:This service can help distinguish between human users and bots. It presents tasks that are easy for humans but difficult for bots. Implementing reCAPTCHAv2 on mobile apps, particularly on forms and other interactive elements, can drastically reduce bot activity. Rate limiting:This involves setting a limit on the number of requests a user or IP address can make within a certain timeframe. If the limit is exceeded, the user or IP is temporarily blocked. This technique can slow down or halt fraudulent traffic, especially from bots performing high-frequency activities. Device fingerprinting:This technique identifies and tracks devices based on their unique configurations, such as the operating system, browser version, installed fonts, etc. By doing this, companies can identify suspicious patterns or recurring fraudulent activity coming from the same device, even if they change their IP addresses or use VPNs. Honeypots:Honeypots are decoy systems or traps that appear as part of an organization’s network but are actually isolated and monitored. They are designed to lure in attackers, who waste their time and resources on the decoy while their actions are recorded and used to improve security measures. Switch to passkeys:This is the new standard that many major companies have adopted. It solves a number of problems, one of which is that there is no real password to leak as the password is always changing. As technology continues to evolve and new forms of AIT fraud emerge, staying informed and up to date is fundamental, according to Gibbons. Continuous learning, adaptability, and vigilance are key to staying one step ahead of the fraudsters. “AIT fraud is a complex, pervasive issue that poses significant challenges for businesses, consumers, and society as a whole,” Gibbons says. “However, by understanding the risks, taking proactive measures, and working together, these risks can be mitigated to create a safer, more trustworthy digital environment.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS Governments won’t like this: encrypted messaging between Android and iOS devices coming, says GSMA

Are capture-the-flag participants obligated to report zero days?,https://www.csoonline.com/article/648938/are-capture-the-flag-participants-obligated-to-report-zero-days.html,"As this year's Hacker Summer Camp gets underway with dozens of CTF events, the obligations for players to report zero-day bugs they discover are murky. Bug reporting up to the CTF player’s code Complexities surround bug reports from CTFs Related content New Windows zero-day feared abused in widespread espionage for years About 22k WAB customers impacted by a zero-day attack on a third-party vendor Microsoft patches privilege escalation flaw exploited since 2023 March Patch Tuesday warnings: Act fast to plug zero day holes in Windows, VMware Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Last month, Googlefixeda minor zero-day Chrome bug discovered by a member of Apple Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR) during an HXP capture the flag (CTF)event. The bug was reported by someone else who also participated in the competition and not the Apple employee who found the bug. The person who reported the bug to Google, Martin Radev, who goes by Sisu,said he did sobecause he was “not 100% sure it was reported to the Chromium team.” Google awarded $10,000 as a bug bounty to Radev, who reported it, and not the Apple employee who found the bug, who goes by Leonardo Leonardo explained that he delayed reporting the bug for several reasons, primarily due to gaining the necessary sign-off within Apple to report the discovery to Google. Radev later presented a timeline of the bug’s discovery and disclosure andemphasizedthat there was “no malicious behavior by either Leonardo or me.” Radev said he and Leonardo are exploring “a good way to make use of the reward” and “a donation is to be made.” As the annual Black Hat and DEFCON conferences get underway this week in Las Vegas, during which over 50 CTF events will be held, this incident underscores a central question: What are the obligations of CTF players to disclose zero-day vulnerabilities to vendors? CTF “is just a game,” David Brumley, Carnegie Mellon University Professor and CEO of ForAllSecure, tells CSO. It’s not the “mission” of CTF players to hunt down zero-day bugs in vendor software, he says, and therefore reporting the bugs to vendors is not typically top of mind for the players. A CTF event is just “one of those places where people have a safe space to play off a tradecraft.” “CTFs are often about the discovery of vulnerabilities that were put there on purpose,” Casey Ellis, founder, chair, and CTO of Bugcrowd, tells CSO. “You’re finding vulnerabilities, breaking software. You’re tipping things upside down to see what falls out in the same way you would if you were doing focused bug hunting or vulnerability research to find things that you wanted to report and see fixed. But the reason that you’re doing it is different.” Generally, it’s up to the CTF participants to use their judgment when submitting a bug report to a vendor, Ellis says. “As a vulnerability researcher, I don’t have to tell the company I found something. If I’m doing that, I’m either doing it because I feel like it’s something I should do to make sure it’s operating and disclosing vulnerabilities in the public interest and ensuring things get fixed. Or the additive reason is if there’s a bug bounty program and there’s some sort of reward for doing that, then I’m encouraged to do that. But in the absence of those two things, if I find a vulnerability as a security searcher, it’s my research, it’s my code, it’s my discovery, and what I do with it from that point forward is really still in my hands.” Nevertheless, complexities surround discoveries of real-world bugs during CTF contests. “To people that look at it all from the outside, they just see the fact that you’ve got hackers breaking stuff and finding problems,” says Ellis. “Surely, they’re going to disclose those issues and try to get them fixed up in the public interest and all that kind of thing. It’s not necessarily a strict rule in that sense. Just because they found something doesn’t mean that they’re bound to this idea of helping the vendor. I certainly hope they do that.” However, Chris Evans, CISO and chief hacking officer at HackerOne, thinks that bugs discovered during a CTF event should invariably be reported to vendors. “CTFs are a great way for hackers to test their skills and participate in the joy of hacking,” Evans tells CSO. “This is an excellent outcome, and any hacker achieving this should be praised,” he adds. “When this happens, standard ethics apply. The hacker has discovered a risk that could harm others and is in a position to get it addressed by reporting the issue to the affected vendor. The risk should be reported as promptly as possible to reduce the possibility of harm to others.” Regarding the incident involving the Apple CTF player who discovered the Google flaw, Evans says, “It’s great that a CTF resulted in the discovery and fixing of a vulnerability in production software. CTFs can be chaotic and confusing environments, so it’s good that everyone worked together to get the best outcomes.” Ellis draws an essential distinction between CTF events and bug bashes, collaborative events held by an organization designed to unearth many bugs within a short time governed by clear-cut rules that the participants agreed to beforehand. “They look a lot like a CTF, but the thing that’s different about it is that they’re actual systems that they’re going to be fixed at the end of the event. That information is meant to get to the recipient or the person, the organization running the contest. That’s literally its entire purpose. So, the rules, the process, and how that all works is clearly established.” Capture-the-flag events are far murkier. With a CTF, the environment is usually fake, and it’s a game. “So, if vulnerabilities get inadvertently discovered in the process, which is a thing that happens, then what happens next is far less clearly defined,” Ellis says. Further muddying the waters is the rise of hybrid events, such as will be the case with a CTF hosted by the AI Village at this year’s DEFCON. “Part of the purpose of that exercise is to disclose potential issues and AI model bias to the vendors of those models and to inform how vulnerabilities gets defined in machine learning and AI, to begin with,” Ellis says. “I think that kind of idea is starting to increase. I think people will be talking about a lot at the end of the week.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS New Windows zero-day feared abused in widespread espionage for years About 22k WAB customers impacted by a zero-day attack on a third-party vendor Microsoft patches privilege escalation flaw exploited since 2023 March Patch Tuesday warnings: Act fast to plug zero day holes in Windows, VMware",capturetheflag participant obligated report zero day year hacker summer camp get underway dozen ctf event obligation player report zeroday bug discover murky bug reporting ctf player code complexity surround bug report ctfs related content new window zeroday feared abused widespread espionage year k wab customer impacted zeroday attack thirdparty vendor microsoft patch privilege escalation flaw exploited since march patch tuesday warning act fast plug zero day hole window vmware section editor straight inbox last month googlefixeda minor zeroday chrome bug discovered member apple security engineering architecture sear hxp capture flag ctfevent bug reported someone else also participated competition apple employee found bug person reported bug google martin radev go sisusaid sobecause sure reported chromium team google awarded bug bounty radev reported apple employee found bug go leonardo leonardo explained delayed reporting bug several reason primarily due gaining necessary signoff within apple report discovery google radev later presented timeline bug discovery disclosure andemphasizedthat malicious behavior either leonardo radev said leonardo exploring good way make use reward donation made annual black hat defcon conference get underway week la vega ctf event held incident underscore central question obligation ctf player disclose zeroday vulnerability vendor ctf game david brumley carnegie mellon university professor ceo forallsecure tell cso mission ctf player hunt zeroday bug vendor software say therefore reporting bug vendor typically top mind player ctf event one place people safe space play tradecraft ctfs often discovery vulnerability put purpose casey elli founder chair cto bugcrowd tell cso youre finding vulnerability breaking software youre tipping thing upside see fall way would focused bug hunting vulnerability research find thing wanted report see fixed reason youre different generally ctf participant use judgment submitting bug report vendor elli say vulnerability researcher dont tell company found something im im either feel like something make sure operating disclosing vulnerability public interest ensuring thing get fixed additive reason there bug bounty program there sort reward im encouraged absence two thing find vulnerability security searcher research code discovery point forward really still hand nevertheless complexity surround discovery realworld bug ctf contest people look outside see fact youve got hacker breaking stuff finding problem say elli surely theyre going disclose issue try get fixed public interest kind thing necessarily strict rule sense found something doesnt mean theyre bound idea helping vendor certainly hope however chris evans ciso chief hacking officer hackerone think bug discovered ctf event invariably reported vendor ctfs great way hacker test skill participate joy hacking evans tell cso excellent outcome hacker achieving praised add happens standard ethic apply hacker discovered risk could harm others position get addressed reporting issue affected vendor risk reported promptly possible reduce possibility harm others regarding incident involving apple ctf player discovered google flaw evans say great ctf resulted discovery fixing vulnerability production software ctfs chaotic confusing environment good everyone worked together get best outcome elli draw essential distinction ctf event bug bash collaborative event held organization designed unearth many bug within short time governed clearcut rule participant agreed beforehand look lot like ctf thing thats different theyre actual system theyre going fixed end event information meant get recipient person organization running contest thats literally entire purpose rule process work clearly established capturetheflag event far murkier ctf environment usually fake game vulnerability get inadvertently discovered process thing happens happens next far less clearly defined elli say muddying water rise hybrid event case ctf hosted ai village year defcon part purpose exercise disclose potential issue ai model bias vendor model inform vulnerability get defined machine learning ai begin elli say think kind idea starting increase think people talking lot end week podcasts video resource event spotlight managing modern risk new window zeroday feared abused widespread espionage year k wab customer impacted zeroday attack thirdparty vendor microsoft patch privilege escalation flaw exploited since march patch tuesday warning act fast plug zero day hole window vmware,Vulnerability
3 strategies that can help stop ransomware before it becomes a crisis,https://www.csoonline.com/article/649540/3-tips-to-help-avoid-a-ransomware-situation.html,"For those hoping to avoid the pay-or-not-to-pay ransomware dilemma, there are three things to focus on that can help CISOs: create incident response plans, improve cybersecurity posture, and invest in robust backups. Why companies pay ransoms 1. Create incident response playbooks 2. Implement multilayered cybersecurity 3. Invest in robust backups Related content Critical remote code execution flaw patched in Veeam backup servers Signal threatens to leave France if encryption backdoor required Report on ransomware attacks on Fortinet firewalls also reveals possible defenses The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Over the past decade, the averagevalue of ransomsdemanded by hackers has gone from hundreds of dollars to hundreds of thousands — even into the millions in some cases. With increasingly stringent regulatory requirements andCISOs being sued for not reporting a breach, the stakes of ransomware attacks are getting ever higher. But specialists say enterprises can avoid getting into such situations in the first place by creating incident response plans, improving their cybersecurity posture, and investing in robust backups of both data and infrastructure. In 2018, Shelley Ma, incident response lead at Coalition, was in a conversation with the executive and technical teams of a company that had just been hit by ransomware. The attack brought the company to a standstill and the ransom was $200,000. “The CEO said, ‘I’m losing $1 million a day. $200,000 for me is chicken feed. So pay it — just pay it,” Ma recalls. In 2015, when she first started dealing with ransomware, most companies paid and the ransoms were usually just a couple hundred dollars. Over time, they’ve gotten larger and now are exorbitant, she says. “We very rarely would see a ransom south of $300,000. Most are in the six figures and quite frequently in the seven or eight figures, too.” According to a report released in July byCoverware, the average size of a ransomware payment has risen to more than $740,000, an increase of 126% compared to the first quarter of 2023 as attackers have begun to target larger enterprises in an attempt to extort ever-increasing payments. And, according to thelatest data from NCC, ransomware attacks hit record levels in June 2023, with a 221% increase over the same time the year before. But there is some good news. According to Coverware, the percentage of ransomware attacks where the victim paid up fell to a record low of 34% because companies have been creating incident response plans, improving their cybersecurity posture, and investing in robust backups of both data and infrastructure. There are two main reasons companies pay money to cybercriminals, the first being that they don’t have any way to recover from ransomware on their own or a recovery would take too much time. “One case we had involved a medical device manufacturer that informed us they were days away from having to issue over 2,000 layoff notifications if something didn’t dramatically change,” says Heath Renfrow, co-founder at Fenix24, a cyber disaster recovery firm. After paying the ransom, they were able to recover enough of the data and systems that the CEO canceled the layoffs, he says. “Most companies we have worked with — over 200 in the last 15 months — would have had to close their doors if they didn’t pay the ransom,” he says. “While we are not necessarily advocating for paying ransoms, we understand that it is truly a business decision and, ethics of paying ransoms aside, it’s a tough position, with many people’s livelihoods, and at times lives and critical infrastructure, at stake.” The second main reason companies pay up is that criminals threaten to release sensitive data. Steve Stone, head of Zero Labs at Rubrik, has worked with numerous clients who’ve been hit by ransomware attacks and sometimes the data is so sensitive that reducing the risk of it being released, by any amount, is worth the money. “A number of organizations have paid the extortion ransom to try to protect data, even if it means that there’s still a chance that it will be leaked,” he says. Of course, you can’t trust the bad guys to keep their word. The data can still be sold through back channels even if it’s not dumped on the dark web. And it still counts as a breach, whether or not the attackers publish the stolen data, and victims still have to be notified. If the data is critical enough, a company may feel it has to do everything it can to keep it from getting out. Some companies might also decide that paying the ransom might save them money when all the recovery costs are considered. But that might not actually be the case. According to anIBM reportreleased in late July 2023, the global average cost of a ransomware attack for companies that didn’t pay the ransom was $5.17 million in 2023. Companies that paid the ransom reduced their total costs only a little, to $5.06 million, a savings of just $110,000, which is usually more than offset by the cost of the ransom itself. Here are three strategies that can help CISOs mitigate the risk and impact of a ransomware strike: The first step in avoiding ransomware attacks is to create a plan whether you expect you’re a potential target or not — assume that it’s more of a question ofwhenyou’ll be hit by a ransomware attack, notif. According to a recentreportconducted by Vanson Bourne on behalf of Barracuda, 73% of companies were hit with at least one successful ransomware attack in 2022. Without an incident response plan in place, companies typically panic, not knowing who to call, or what to do, which can make paying the ransom seem like the easiest way out. With a plan in place, however, people know what to do and will ideally have practised the plan ahead of time to ensure disaster recovery measures work the way they’re supposed to. An incident response plan should include clear roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, and recovery strategies. According toPalo Alto’s 2023 ransomware and extortion report, ransomware victims should prepare for three kinds of attacks: encryption of data and systems, data theft, and (more recently) harassment. The percentage of ransomware attacks that involved data theft rose to 70% in late 2022 from 40% in 2021, while incidents of harassment rose to 20% from less than 1%. So, incident response plans should include not only measures to recover from ransomware encryption and protocols for dealing with threats of leaked data, but also what to do in the event that employees or clients are being harassed. For example, attackers might call and leave voicemails for company executives and employees, send emails, and disclose victims’ identities on a leak site or social media. These tactics are designed to increase pressure on decision-makers. In general, the companies that are able to recover from ransomware attacks the fastest are those that had incident response plans in place and had practiced them ahead of time. Fortunately, the industry overall has been getting better in this regard, Ma says. “There’s been significant growth in incident response in general.” Testing the plan is critical since processes that work on paper can often fail in practice. For example, Ma has run into situations where companies had backups but they were invalid or inaccessible or were not set up in a way that a company could use them for quick disaster recovery. Companies that find themselves in this situation might panic and decide to pay the ransomware after all. But decryption tools often fail when it comes to restoring complex systems brought down by ransomware. “Even if you’re able to get your complete data sets decrypted, it’s hard to get the complex configurations back and running like they were pre-incident,” Ma says. For most companies, focusing on basic security hygiene is the fastest way to reduce ransomware risks. “[The cybersecurity industry’s] goal isn’t to make our networks impenetrable,” says Frank Dickson, group VP for security and trust research practice at IDC. “It’s to elevate the defenses to such a point that it’s no longer profitable to penetrate them.” According to anIDC surveyconducted in June, companies that had no ransomware breaches typically used some or all of five key security technologies: endpoint detection and response (EDR), cloud security gateways or cloud access security brokers (CASB), security information and event management (SIEM) systems, identity analytics or user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA), and network detection and response (NDR). Having multiple layers of defense, as well as setting up multifactor authentication and data encryption, are fundamental to cybersecurity, but many companies still get them wrong. Stone recently worked with an educational organization that had invested heavily in cybersecurity. When they were hit by ransomware, they were able to shift operations to an offline backup. Then the attackers escalated their demands — if the organization didn’t pay the ransom, their data would be leaked online. “The organization was well prepared for an encryption event, but not prepared for the second ransom,” Stone says.  “There was actual sensitive data that would trigger a number of regulatory compliance actions.” The company didn’t want to see the data leaked, but neither did they trust the attackers to keep their promises. “What this organization chose to do is not pay the second ransom, either,” Stone says. Instead, while the attackers were waiting for an answer, the organization notified victims about the breach. “By the time the data leaked online, they had already completed the notification actions.” The attack exposed two major weaknesses in the company’s defense strategy. First of all, their incident response playbook didn’t cover a second extortion event. Second, they hadn’t encrypted their sensitive data. Afterward, they went back to revise their strategy, starting with their response playbook. “How do we get better at this? How do we reduce our risk? How do we do things differently next time?” Stone says, which also led them to encrypt sensitive data. Security controls work, and over the years, companies have gotten better at protecting themselves. Rubrik conducts security assessments of organizations “and that score was up 16% last year, with improvements in every single region and every single industry,” Stone says. With the proper measures in place, companies can reduce both the number and the severity of successful attacks and get up and running again quickly after they’ve been hit. “It boils down to cost,” says Omdia analyst Adam Strange. “Organizations just have not had the budgets to be able to put themselves into a secure position.” Data has long been regarded as one of the most important assets in an organization. “But the way we’ve protected it — or not, over the past few years — has been deplorable, really,” he says. “If an organization is going to die because it hasn’t got access to its data, then it needs to put a lot more thought into how it protects its data.” It’s only with the advent ofGDPRandCCPAthat data security has been emerging as a separate discipline in its own right, he adds. When ransomware attackers get a foothold into an organization, they have two main objectives: to get to the valuable data and to neutralize the backups. “The best-case scenario is robust backups that are in the cloud, and completely disconnected from the main network,” says Ma. “And tape backups, usually run less frequently, but completely segregated and not accessible via the internet.” If attackers get access to domain credentials, they shouldn’t be able to access the backups as well. “If the backups require a second set of authentication they’re a lot more protected,” Ma says. Another backup strategy is immutable backups that cannot be overwritten or erased. “Some of the larger companies do have that implemented. But for smaller and medium-sized companies, the topic of immutable backups doesn’t make it to the boardroom. They’re still relying on backup technology from 2016—and that’s not good enough in today’s day and age,” she says. Rubrikrecently conducted an analysis of several thousand organizations, from both customer and non-customer environments, and 99% of enterprises had data backups in place when they were hit by ransomware. But 93% of companies also had significant challenges using those backups to recover lost data. “There was either not enough data storage, or not enough expertise, or an inadequate portion of their environment was covered,” says Stone. Also, in 73% of the incidents, the attackers had some success in accessing the backups, he adds. If the backups weren’t secured properly, attackers were able to delete backups or use compromised credentials to access management panels. If the backups failed or were deleted by attackers, paying the ransom might seem like the only way out. But, according to the Rubrik report, only 16% of organizations recovered all data after paying the ransomware demand. The reason? The ransomware gangs aren’t very good at their decryption tools and aren’t particularly motivated, either. As long as their tools do something, anything, the victims have hope. According to Stone, today’s ransomware attacks are rarely conducted by a single group. Instead, there’s an attack ecosystem. One actor finds the vulnerability that gets them into an environment. Another plants the ransomware. A third steals data and resells it. Someone else uses stolen credentials to launch more attacks. Other actors may use the same access path to plant crypto-miners, or more ransomware. “It’s not unusual for multiple threat actors to be involved in an intrusion,” Stone says. So it’s not a surprise that, according to Barracuda, 38% of organizations reported two or more successful ransomware attacks in 2022—up from fewer than 20% in 2019. “You can become an annuity for the criminals because they can keep asking for more money,” says Catherine Castaldo, partner with Reed Smith’s tech and data practice. “We’ve seen this happen, especially in sensitive areas like hospitals and law firms.” Companies that are avoiding investing in multilayered security, strong encryption, multifactor authentication and robust backups because they think they won’t be hit by ransomware — or, if they are, that it would be cheaper to just pay the ransom and get back to work — are living in the past. This strategy might have worked in 2013 when ransomware attacks were rare and ransoms were tiny. But it doesn’t work today.

6 best practices to defend against corporate account takeover attacks,https://www.csoonline.com/article/648631/6-best-practices-to-defend-against-corporate-account-takeover-attacks.html,"When bad actors get control of business or corporate accounts, it can be more dangerous than comprised personal or consumer accounts. Here are some ways to stop them. Common attacks that can lead to corporate account takeover attacks Types of corporate organizations targeted by these attacks Financial institutions are frequently targeted by CATO attacks Six best practices to defend against corporate account takeover attacks Related content Trump shifts cyberattack readiness to state and local governments in wake of info-sharing cuts SpyCloud’s 2025 Identity Exposure Report Reveals the Scale and Hidden Risks of Digital Identity Threats Attack time frames are shrinking rapidly. Here’s how cyber teams can cope The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  While there are similarities between the two, corporate account takeovers (CATO) often have larger implications than breaches affecting individual accounts and can result in significant financial losses, reputational damage, and compromised sensitive business information. “In the corporate environment, the main focus is preventing attackers from getting your employees’ credentials,” says Gartner cybersecurity analyst Akif Khan. “And that can consist of a few different attack vectors. There are the more traditional social engineering attack vectors and attack vectors that could include malware being put on your device somehow, which would log your keyboard strokes and look for credentials that were saved on your device.” According to the Expel Quarterly Threat ReportQ1 2023, identity-based attacks [account compromise, corporate account takeover, and long-lived access key theft] accounted for 57% of all incidents identified in Q1 2023. The tools and techniques cybercriminals use are similar for both consumers and corporations, but the impact of a corporate account takeover can be much more significant, says Michael Halstead, managing director of finance and insurance at Launch Consulting. According to Halstead, the attack vectors bad actors use include: Phishing:This remains a popular method of attack as it has become much more sophisticated with evasive strategies, such as testing to avoid common defensive tooling. Artificial intelligence (AI) has also created new challenges with near-perfect phishing emails. SMS text messages have also become a popular technique as unlike email, mobile phones don’t have strong filters to block text messages containing spam or smishing attempts. Pretexting:The human equivalent of phishing where an attacker creates a false pretext, e.g., impersonating a person in authority, to deceive employees into revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions. Business email compromise (BEC):This specifically targets corporate email accounts. Attackers compromise or spoof executive or employee email accounts to trick others within the organization or external parties into performing fraudulent actions. This can include wire transfers, changing payment details, or disclosing sensitive information. In 2022, the FBI IC3 (Internet Crimes Complaint Unit)received 21,832 BEC complaintswith adjusted losses of over $2.7 billion. Social engineering:Uses human psychology and trust to manipulate individuals, often employees, into divulging sensitive information or granting unauthorized access. Like phishing, social engineering attacks have become much more sophisticated with the use of AI to impersonate legitimate entities via phone calls or video. Phone calls impersonating legitimate entities: Attackers target company executives, business partners, or financial institutions, to trick employees into revealing login credentials, account details, or sensitive information, which can then be used to gain unauthorized access to corporate accounts. Deepfakes: The use of AI to create a video or audio recording of a high-ranking executive or colleague to trick an employee into transferring funds, sharing sensitive data, or giving an attacker control over a corporate account. Deepfake will likely become more prevalent as advances in AI are made and news of successful attacks increase. Leveraging insiders:Bad actors use employees to assist with corporate account takeovers. The motivation can be financial, affinity to a particular cause, and/or threats of blackmail. Employees or individuals with privileged access can be convinced to misuse their privileges for personal gain or malicious purposes. “A corporate account takeover attack can occur for a large variety of objectives unique to the attackers’ specific interests or goals, in addition to who the target may be,” says Tom Hegel, a senior threat researcher at SentinelLabs. “For example, we commonly observe opportunistic stealer malware campaigns associated with the larger crimeware scene-stealing account credentials from average business employees,” Hegel says. In these opportunistic attacks, the attackers easily steal credentials used by the employees to access third-party websites, such as businesses banking accounts, he says. “More concerning, the attacks can seek to collect the login details of an employee into the business network or communications platform, such as email or messengers,” Hegel says. These details, now in the hands of the attacker, can be used in a variety of ways to financially benefit them. Direct financial theft, data theft, or even selling the access they have to interested parties, are all highly probable scenarios occurring today.” Any organization that does business online can be targeted by a CATO attack, though primarily such attacks target corporate entities that perform financial transactions online, says Sourya Biswas, technical director of risk management and governance at security consulting firm NCC Group. Halstead agrees, adding that although any organization is at risk for corporate account takeovers, bad actors often target certain organizations due to their size, availability of funds, and type of valuable data and secrets. Some organizations that are continuously targeted are financial institutions, healthcare organizations, and government agencies. Gil Vega, chief information security officer at Veeam Software, says attackers have made a lot of attempts against his company’s employees. “Typically, what will happen is, there’ll be an attacker that’s usually part of a pretty well-funded criminal enterprise overseas who will send someone a convincing looking text message, or an email, or a phishing link that they’ll hope that the recipient will click on,” he says. “And once that’s clicked on it will launch some type of malicious software that allows direct connectivity between the attacker and the victim.” However, Vega adds that none of those attempts has yet been successful. “The reason is that one of the most important things you can do to prevent this is to enhance the awareness of your employees,” he says. “And we spend a lot of calories here at Veeam making sure our employees understand the threat. We do that through simulation, through mandatory training requirements, through policy attestations. We stay on top of our employees with this information every quarter with different campaigns testing our ability to resist these kinds of attempts.” Vega also concurs that malicious actors often target financial institutions, pointing to the successful CATO attack on theRobinhood brokerage platform in November 2021. The company said that in that attack that “The unauthorized party socially engineered a customer support employee by phone and obtained access to certain customer support systems.” The attacker stole a list of email addresses for about 5 million individuals and the full names of an additional 2 million individuals, according to the company. The hacker also obtained full names, dates of birth, and ZIP codes of 310 of Robinhood’s customers and more extensive account details of 10 customers, although the company noted that that hacker did not obtain customers’ Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, or debit card numbers, and none had suffered any financial losses. However, after Robinhood contained the intrusion, the attacker demanded an extortion payment. Consequently, Robinhood “promptly informed law enforcement and are continuing to investigate the incident with the help of Mandiant, a leading outside security firm.” The result of the investigation is unclear. Anotherexample is Twitter, says Halstead. “[In 2020] attackers gained access to the internal systems of Twitter through a social engineering and phishing scheme targeting employees,” he says. “Bad actors took over an internal IT administrator tool that was used to manage accounts. They leveraged prominent accounts, including those of high-profile individuals and companies, such as Coinbase, and used them to promote a cryptocurrency scam.” The hackers stole more than $118,000 worth of Bitcoin. While there is no one security practice and control that can prevent CATO attacks, several used in combination (defense in depth), can significantly reduce the risk, says Biswas.  Here are six best practices to prevent corporate account takeover attacks Defense in Depth Companies must implement a defense-in-depth approach, Halstead says. Maintaining a healthy security posture remains paramount in preventing corporate account takeovers among other cyberattacks. “Organizations must implement layers of defense that include vulnerability management, network segmentation, email/web filtering, intrusion detection and monitoring, third-party risk management, and incident response.” Multifactor authentication (MFA) and morefor online account access It’s important to have strong multifactor authentication around all corporate accounts, says Bryan Willett, CISO at Lexmark. “What we’re finding with some of the latest phishing services that are out there, such as EvilProxy, is that they’re getting very good at imitating a login screen that looks just like your corporate login screen and your corporate MFA challenge,” Willett says. “And the user has the potential of falling victim to that and sharing their MFA.” However, while companies need to continue enhancing their MFA they also need to continue looking at more advanced MFA methods, such as Fido keys, Willet says. But those more advanced methods are an investment, so organizations must decide whether they’re going to invest in them. Strong access management strategies Implementing strong access management measures is essential, particularly through the utilization of privileged access management tools, according to Halstead. “And regular access reviews that also involve third parties are of utmost importance,” he says. “It is vital to establish procedures for both personnel joining and leaving the organization to uphold the principle of least privilege.” Contextual access management measures Organizations should also implement contextual access management that considers a user’s current location, the device being used, time of access, network environment, behavior patterns, and other contextual information, according to Halstead. “By doing so, the risk of unauthorized access, often exploited in corporate account takeovers, can be significantly minimized,” he says. Robust security monitoring At Lexmark, security monitoring is performed by the security operations team. “They perform a 24-hour-a-day, seven-days-a-week function where they’re monitoring every alert that comes out of our tool sets,” Willett says. “The toolsets are everything from our endpoint detection and response to our identity systems. For instance, in identity one of the triggers that frequently occurs when someone’s trying to do a business email compromise is some form of travel-type alert, where we saw someone logged in one location and all of a sudden, they’re showing up in a very different part of the world and that sets off an alarm.” Employee education and training — a human firewall Employee education and awareness are critical, says Halstead. This “human firewall” remains a very important defense in preventing corporate account takeovers. “Ensure you regularly educate and train employees about the risks associated with corporate account takeovers, particularly those professionals who have privileged access or are in highly targeted areas, such as payments and finance,” he says. This includes making employees aware of the key things to look for in an email to know that it was amalicious emailor had malicious intent in some way, Willett says. “Everything from looking at the sender, looking at the URL they’re trying to send you too,” he says. “If you do happen to click on the URL and you see a login screen, make sure the login screen is going to a domain or URL that makes sense.

"AI-automated malware campaigns coming soon, says Mikko Hyppönen",https://www.csoonline.com/article/575433/ai-automated-malware-campaigns-coming-soon-says-mikko-hypponen.html,"The industry pioneer also expects cybersecurity to remain a growth business for years and sees Russian hacktivists as demoralizing European infosec teams. A maturing cybersecurity industry European cyber threats rise in wartime Complete automation of malware campaigns is coming Related content Attack time frames are shrinking rapidly. Here’s how cyber teams can cope The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time Almost 1 million business and home PCs compromised after users visited illegal streaming sites: Microsoft Linux, macOS users infected with malware posing as legitimate Go packages Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Cybersecurity pioneer Mikko Hyppönen began his cybersecurity career 32 years ago at Finnish cybersecurity company F-Secure, two years before Tim Berners-Lee released the world’s first web browser. Since then, he hasdefusedglobal viruses,searchedfor the first virus authors in a Pakistani conflict zone, and traveled the globe advising law enforcement and governments on cybercrime. He has also recently published a book,If It’s Smart, It’s Vulnerable,where he explains how the growth of internet connectivity has fueled cyber threats. CSO recently had the opportunity to speak with Hyppönen at this year’s Sphere conference for a wide-ranging interview about the state of the industry, the growing cybersecurity threats facing Europe, and the promise and peril ofartificial intelligence. The once-hot tech sector has hit a wall,trimmingits ranks by 168,243 employees so far in 2023. Tech giants Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta have retrenched from their past decade of seemingly boundless upsides as recessionary pressures and other economic factors have cooled their once-rosy projections. Despite pockets of layoffs, the cybersecurity industry seems to be largelyimmuneto the woes affecting Silicon Valley, with the demand for new employees seemingly “as strong as it ever has been” in the chronically understaffed sector. “There will always be threats. There will always be bad people,” Hyppönen, who is now the chief research officer at WithSecure, tells CSO. “There’s a steady need for security.Cybersecuritywill remain a growth business for as long as I can see. I do believe there’s job security in cybersecurity.” (WithSecure was known as F-Secure for Business until last year when it split off from the now consumer-oriented F-Secure, for which Hyppönen also serves as principal research advisor). When Hyppönen began his career, there was no cybersecurity industry of significance. Now, analysts project that the industry willtop$162 billion USD in revenue during 2023, with slightly more thanthree dozen companiesthat collectively have a market cap exceeding $624 billion USD and account for the lion’s share of that revenue. Given this state of maturation, the question remains whether there is room for new cybersecurity entrants. “For years the barriers for entry for newcomers and to cybersecurity were massive because of the amount of work you had to do to understand the problems that build a library of detections for all the possible attacks, which took years and years for companies to build,” Hyppönen says. “So, we believe there won’t be real new startups in endpoint security.” “You actually can enter the game with new technologies based on anomaly detection and machine learning,” Hyppönen says. “So, you don’t have to be able to detect all the possible attacks we’ve always seen. It’s enough if you can detect anomalies, that something weird is happening, something unusual, something which doesn’t happen normally.” Hyppönen believes the need to detect weird and unusual things has “actually opened the doors for plenty of new companies stood up by a new generation of researchers” who grew up online and are unconstrained by conventional thinking. “So, it’s probably not good for business for us to welcome new competitors in the space,” he says. “But personally, I love seeing that.” Since Russia invaded Ukraine last year, European organizations have experienced a rising tide of cyber threats from Russian-allied threat actors, who, while inflicting only minor damage, have subjected government agencies and companies across the continent to psychological malaise, Hyppönen says. One group in particular, the little-reported so-called hacktivist group NoName057(16), has engaged in asteady onslaughtof DDoS attacks across Europe through a projectcalled DDosiasince March 2022 alongside other pro-Russian groups, including Killnet. Hyppönen scanned the NoName057(16) Telegram channel, the group’s primary mode of communication, and read aloud a list of the group’s recent attacks. “France. An airport in Germany. A German weapons manufacturer. An Italian bank. The Italian public sector. These kinds of attacks are the wake-up calls for companies because many of the targets of the attacks done by gangs which are not from the government but are like private patriot hackers from Russia,” he says. (However, Illia Vitiuk, the head of the Department of Cyber Information Security in the Security Service of Ukraine,saidat the RSA conference in April that she believes the Russian hacktivists are state-sponsored.) “They hit surprising targets like an airport in France,” which is likely baffled to be caught up in the conflict, Hyppönen says. “But these guys are looking for symbolic hits, which are on our hearts and minds. These attacks are specific to the war in Ukraine, and almost all the targets we see are in Europe.” A separate group of pro-Russian hackerstook downFinland’s defense ministry website just as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy began a video address to the country’s parliament. “When was the last time anyone visited the website of the defense ministry? No one ever goes there,” Hyppönen says. “So, the website has no importance whatsoever. Go down and stay down for the rest of the year, and no one will miss the website. That has no effect on the operational capability of our ministry, defense forces, or military. None of that.” With no actual destructive component, the point of these attacks is to weaken European morale, Hyppönen says. “It feels bad. It really does feel bad. And that’s what they’re trying to do.” ChatGPT and dozens of rapidly emerging AI apps were the hottest topics at Sphere, with their potential to foster cybercrime and scams more effectively. “They’re exciting and scary at the same time,” Hyppönen said during his keynote. “And make no mistake: We are all living the hottest AI summer in history.” Despite AI’s potential for upending industries and making it easier for threat actors to advance their malicious activities, Hyppönen tells CSO that it’s “mandatory” for the cybersecurity industry to embrace the technology. “There’s no other way for companies like us to keep up with the number of attacks except by using automation, machine learning, and AI,” he says. “We’ve been using it for quite a while already.” It will only be a matter of months before malicious threat actors use widely available AI source code to perfect their techniques. “What I’m really waiting for, and it’s going to happen in the next couple of months, is complete automation of malware campaigns,” he says. “Because right now it’s humans, attackers working at human speed against defenders like our systems or security companies in general, which use automation and machine learning to find and react to new attacks very quickly.” The downside for cyber defenders is that AI functioning becomes impenetrable at a certain point due to a lack of visibility and understanding of how it works. For example, Hyppönen says, “A customer calls and asks, ‘Hey, you’re blocking this program we made, and why did you block this?’ We can’t answer. The machine says so.” That program could be whitelisted and manually checked, “but we can’t answer the client anymore why it believes it’s bad because it’s a machine learning framework,” Hyppönen says. “It’s a black box. It’s been teaching itself for too long.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS Attack time frames are shrinking rapidly.

Here’s how cyber teams can cope The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Announced in June 2022, the Cybercrime Atlas is an initiative from the World Economic Forum (WEF) to map activities of cybercriminals and create a database that can be used by law enforcement across the world to disrupt the cyber-criminal ecosystem. Cybercrime Atlas officially launched in February 2023 in a partnership between WEF and Banco Santander, Fortinet, Microsoft, and PayPal. Cybercrime Atlas was conceptualized by WEF’sPartnership against Cybercrime, which includes more than 40 public and private organizations. The first iteration had “really smart” analysts from organizations throughout the globe brought together to come up with a normalized taxonomy from where samples would be selected. From this, 13 major known threat actors were the initial focus. Using open-source intelligence the analysts looked at things like the bad guy’s name, the address that they’re known to live at, their bank account details, their crypto wallet details, their social media footprint, known bulletproof hosting, and other malicious services that they’re using. “The idea was we collect all the information that we knew we could find from open source on these guys, normalize it, vet it, and then put it into a repository,” Glenn Maiden, director of threat intelligence operations at FortiGuard Labs ANZ, tells CSO. All the information collected is investigated to find the single source of truth, cull out the noise and have human verified intelligence. The aim is to build a comprehensive picture of the cybercrime landscape covering criminal operations, shared infrastructure, and networks. The result, the involved parties expect, will be that the links between the information gathered about threat actors will help the security industry more effectively disrupt the cybercriminal ecosystem. For this initial iteration, actionable intelligence has been collected from 13 criminal groups across the main attack landscape — ransomware, business email compromise, malware, and card fraud. “The insights generated will help promote opportunities for greater cooperation between the private sector and law enforcement to address cybercrime,” Jeremy Jurgens, managing director for the World Economic Forum, said in astatement. These will eventually be shared with global law enforcement groups such as Interpol and FBI, but it will also help the analysts and vendors involved — those who lent their best analysts — to find commonalities in the attackers’ actions and ways. “We’ve actually found linkages between organized crime gangs and even nation state entities, they’re all operating together,” Maiden says. In February 2023 was when the project was deemed ready to begin to move from the prototype phase to minimum viable product. Or, in other words, from ad hoc systems and repositories to having dedicated project managers, finding the most appropriate, robust system to build the database, and working out the business logic. “There’s going to be some people that are contributors, there’s going to be some people that are consumers, there’s going to be some people that are both,” Maiden says. This will require the build of rules around clusters, with “need to know” clusters for those that might want to collaborate on a particular crime or case. Information being used to build this repository is based on information that is available widely which means no issues with different countries’ laws on data. That also means once they have an open-source repository there won’t be any security or proprietary constraints and sharing. When it is ready it will be able to be shared with local law enforcement participant agencies. Unfortunately, this won’t be something that commercial organizations across the world are likely to benefit from directly. Companies that have been supporting the project by sending their best analysts to help in the creation of the data base will have access to it, but this is a tool created for law enforcement. When the database is ready and has been in use, local law enforcement in different countries that have their own non-public intelligence could potentially use it to cross refence those two data sets and augment their own source intelligence. The Cybercrime Atlas is still being developed and not mature enough to consider larger questions such as what happens when threat actors start seeing them as a threat and start producing convincing false information to lead the investigations somewhere else. But “a lot of money” has been put into this and there is likely to be a lot of interest from law enforcement agencies across the world. Maiden shares that Fortinet is looking at other opportunities with the community that was created and other opportunities to disrupt. This could be “us looking at potentially a legal or policy change in a certain jurisdiction where these bad guys are, running some of their operations or infrastructure — looking at some of these broader implications based on that initial, platform and community.” Despite details of major attacks being usually kept under lock and key, collaboration among cybersecurity professionals has always existed. Having the support of an independent organization such as the World Economic Forum could help not only bringing a worldwide community together, but it may also bring an extra level of trust. It is unlikely that all nations will benefit from it, at least not while state sponsored attacks are a threat and nations where attackers may be based chose to not cooperate with other countries. One recent example of this is that when trying to work with Russia, Five Eyes member Australia revealed it had yet to get a response from Russia regarding the cyberattack on private health insurance providerMedibank. In November 2022, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) revealed that those responsible for the Medibank data breach were in Russia. Following aFive Eyes law enforcement meeting in Melbourne, Australia, AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw shared in an interview withNine’s 60 Minutesthat Australia is still waiting to receive intelligence back from Russia. “We have shared our viewpoint on who we think some of these individuals and groups are. Given the fact that we shared some very detailed, specific intelligence, we’d like to see a result come back and we are still waiting on that front.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS Trump shifts cyberattack readiness to state and local governments in wake of info-sharing cuts SpyCloud’s 2025 Identity Exposure Report Reveals the Scale and Hidden Risks of Digital Identity Threats Attack time frames are shrinking rapidly.

How CISOs can talk effectively about a cyber incident’s toll Attack time frames are shrinking rapidly. Here’s how cyber teams can cope Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  With an ever-increasing number of cybersecurity threats and attacks, companies are becoming motivated to protect their businesses and customer data both technically and financially. Finding the right insurance has become a key part of the security equation, which is no surprise given that the averagecost of a data breachin the US has risen to $9.44 million — more than twice the global average of $4.35 million. The global cyber insurance market was valued at $13.33 billion in 2022, according toresearch by Fortune Business Insights, and is expected to grow from $16.66 billion in 2023 to $84.62 billion by 2030. North America is projected to dominate the market due to increasing cyberattacks, particularly ransomware, and a high risk of data loss, while Europe will also gain a prominent market share, in part because “digitalization among organizations remains vulnerable to malicious cyberattacks.” Companies in the US looking to protect themselves have most likely heard the terms “cyber liability insurance” and “data breach insurance.” While they’re often used interchangeably and many organizations tend to think they’re the same, that’s not the case. Understanding the distinction is important, ascyber insuranceis becoming an integral part of the security landscape. Many companiesmay have no choice but to find insuranceas more organizations are requiring that their business partners have cyber coverage. Many traditional business insurance policies will simply not cover cyber incidents, considering them outside the scope of the agreement, which is why cyber insurance has become a separate form of protection. It’s also important to note that getting insurance isn’t guaranteed — insurers are increasingly asking for more proof that strong cybersecurity strategies are in place before agreeing to provide coverage. Many companies may have no choice but to meet such terms. Put simply, cyber liability insurance refers to coverage for third-party claims asserted against a company stemming from a network security event or data breach. Data breach insurance, on the other hand, refers to coverage for first-party losses incurred by the insured organization that has suffered a loss of data. Here’s a closer look at each: Cyber liability is defined as the potential for an organization to cause damage to other organizations or individuals, says Zachary Kaiser, strategic risk advisor at McClone, an independent insurance agency. “When we talk about liability, we’re talking about security liability, for example, transferring malware to another party, and privacy liability, for instance, accidentally disclosing customers’ personally identifiable information,” he says. Cyber liability insurance provides coverage that helps protect organizations against direct expenses incurred as a result of responding to and recovering from data security incidents and any associated legal costs and liability, says Allen Blount, cyber team leader at Risk Strategies. For example, a company experiences a cyberattack on its computer systems by hackers that results in the compromise or theft of sensitive customer information. These customers may choose to file a lawsuit or class action against the company for failing to adequately safeguard their sensitive personal information and expose them to the risk of future harm, including fraud and identity theft, says Anjali Das, partner and co-chair of the national cybersecurity and data privacy practice team at Wilson Elser LLP. “Cyber liability insurance usually provides coverage for the defense of such third-party claims and lawsuits, including potential damages, judgments, and/or settlements,” she says. “But cyber liability insurance can also provide first-party coverage,” says Layna Cook Rush, a shareholder at Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz PC and the head of the firm’s data incident response team. Cyber liability insurance is aimed at providing comprehensive protection against cyberattacks and typically covers a wide range of cyber incidents, such as ransomware attacks, data theft and extortion, and phishing email scams, Rush says. It provides both first-party and third-party coverage. First-party coverage insures against financial losses incurred by the company in responding to the incident including investigation of the incident, remediation of affected systems, any required notifications, and the cost of credit monitoring services, according to Rush. Kiran Boosam, vice president and global insurance industry leader at Capgemini, agreed that cyber liability insurance is usually a comprehensive policy covering the losses or damages for both the organization that buys the policy and other affected parties, such as individuals or businesses. A comprehensive cyber liability insurance policy typically covers monetary losses, such as lost revenue and profits, additional costs related to notifying affected customers, recovering the compromised data, and repairing damaged equipment and computers. It also covers an organization’s legal expenses, such as legal fees, monetary settlements to cover the losses to other affected parties, as well as any punitive damages such as regulatory fines, Boosam says. “For instance, a malware attack occurs at a bank exposing proprietary data and its customers’ personally identifiable information (PII) data, taking down the bank’s website,” he says. “A comprehensive cyber liability insurance will not only protect the financial interest of the bank and its clients against the PII data breach, but it will also cover the financial losses and associated costs incurred due to interruption to the bank’s online businesses.” Data breach insurance is a subset of cyber liability insurance and protects against only some of the losses associated with a cyber incident, according to Rush. Data breach insurance provides only first-party coverage and not third-party coverage. “Data breach insurance does not cover third-party claims, such as lawsuits against the company by impacted individuals or third parties or regulatory action by state or federal government agencies,” Rush says. “Cyber liability insurance is generally more comprehensive than data breach insurance because it covers both first-party and third-party liability.” Data breach coverage refers to first-party losses incurred by the insured company that has experienced a network security event or cyberattack, according to Das. Such first-party losses may include business interruption losses, legal fees, costs to hire a cybersecurity firm to conduct a forensics investigation of the nature and scope of the incident, and costs incurred to notify affected individuals of the incident if it results in the compromise of their personal information, Das says. Additional first-party losses that might be covered under a data breach insurance policy include public relations costs or even ransom or extortion payments to cyber criminals. Jaime Palumbo, vice president of claims at Corvus Insurance, says data breach insurance is not a particular form of insurance, but rather a subset of a comprehensive policy. A data breach or incident is typically where sensitive or personal information of employees, customers, clients, etc., is accessed or taken from the policyholder without authorization, she says. In the context of insurance coverage, a cyber policy can provide both first-party and third-party coverage for this type of incident in various ways. “It generally provides coverage for breach response expenses, which are the costs associated with retaining breach or privacy counsel or a digital forensics vendor to perform a review of the affected systems,” Palumbo says. Also, if the policyholder experiences a period of downtime or system interruption due to the cyber incident, there may be business income loss available, she says. And tying in the liability component, coverage would also exist if the policyholder was served with a lawsuit filed by the individuals whose data was affected in the breach. Fortunately for those interested in purchasing cyber insurance, the cyber product offering generally comes standard with an array of first-party and third-party coverage to ensure that a policyholder is protected against its own losses as well as the cyber losses of others that it may have caused, Palumbo says. “However, a company should still remain vigilant when evaluating coverage to ensure that all avenues of risk for their respective industry classes are covered,” she says. “The company should understand what data it stores, maintains, and collects to appreciate the impact and ramifications of a potential data breach. Knowing the volume and sensitive nature of maintained records can translate to the amount of coverage necessary to cover a loss.” Rahul Mahna, a partner of outsourced IT services at EisnerAmper, cautions companies to read the fine print to determine the limitations on first-party and third-party coverage. “Cyber liability and data breach insurance are not substitutes for a robust cybersecurity policy — they are complementary,” Mahna says. “Any company that gambles on a cheaper, after-the-incident solution, such as insurance, in lieu of the necessary people, training, technology, and processes to prevent incidents from ever happening are playing a dangerous, risky game.” Things work a little differently in the UK and Australia says Richard Hodson, founder of London-based RC Hodson Insurance Services. In the UK, companies purchase “cyber insurance,” which covers both first- and third-party costs if an organization’s data or systems have been compromised, damaged, lost, or stolen. In the UK, cyber insurance comes in two parts: cyber liability insurance, which is the same as third-party insurance, and first-party insurance, says Hodson. Cyber insurance helps protect businesses against the financial implications of data breaches, security failures, illegal threats, or cyberattacks. “We don’t use the phrases ‘cyber liability insurance’ and ‘data breach insurance’ in the UK because organizations buy both parts of the cyber insurance policy,” he says. “Companies buy cyber insurance because it covers their own losses for the costs of the investigation and bringing in the forensic people to determine what happened in the event of a breach and any fines for its own losses, for example, as well as the losses suffered by third-parties.” “So, the way we sell cyber insurance is very different and the same is true in Australia as well,” Hodson says. “The Australians follow the UK model.” TheNational Cyber Security Centrein the UK offers some advice that applies to companies in the US as well as the UK. “Cyber insurance will not instantly solve all of your cybersecurity issues, and it will not prevent a cyber breach/attack,” according to the organization. “Just as homeowners with household insurance are expected to have adequate security measures in place, organizations must continue to put measures in place to protect what they care about.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS Trump shifts cyberattack readiness to state and local governments in wake of info-sharing cuts SpyCloud’s 2025 Identity Exposure Report Reveals the Scale and Hidden Risks of Digital Identity Threats That breach cost HOW MUCH?

And the types of deepfakes we’re seeing today, such as thefake of Russian President Vladimir Putindeclaring martial law over trusted television and radio stations, are only the beginning. Deepfakes can ruin a company’s reputation, bypass biometric controls, phish unsuspecting users into clicking malicious links, and convince financial agents to transfer money to offshore accounts. Attacks leveraging deepfakes can happen over many channels from social media tofake person-to-person video calls over Zoom. Voicemail, Slack channels, email, mobile messaging, and metaverses are all fair game for distributing deepfake scams to businesses and personal users. Cyber liability insurers are beginning to take notice, and as they do, their security requirements are beginning to adjust to the new ‘fake’ reality. This includes, but is not limited to, better hygiene across the enterprise, renewed focus on home worker systems, enforced multifactor authentication, out-of-band confirmation to avoid falling for deepfake phishing attempts, user and partner education, and third-party context-based verification services or tools. In early June, two instances of voicemail impersonation were reported to Rob Ferrini, cyber insurance program manager at McGowanPRO, headquartered in Framingham, Massachusetts, with 5,000 cyber-insured clients covered by its insurance partners. One led to an open claim under investigation, in which the insured was an accounting firm and an accountant there received a voicemail from one of his business customers to change the instructions for a vendor and make payment on a $77,000 invoice. “The accountant then called their client to verify, and his client reported that he got the same voicemail from their vendor account, so it’s probably OK. It ended up that the accountant’s client paid a $77,000 invoice to a fraudulent bank account,” Ferrini says. While the accountant did his due diligence and called his client, the client did not do their diligence and call their vendor for confirmation that the voicemail was real. If the insurance investigators cannot claw the money back, the accountant’s client may not get reimbursed. Inversely, in that same week, a wealth manager contacted Ferrini to tell him how out-of-band authentication (OOBA) protected his client from falling for an impersonator trying to get him to open a fake mortgage. Before giving away any information to the scammer, the client simply called to ask the wealth manager if that was true, and he told him it was fake. “Many cyber insurance carriers require out-of-band authentication controls to underwrite policies. Out-of-band authentication would mean you call them directly, making sure with two different methods that this person is who they say they are before wiring money to a new account,” says Ryan Bell, threat intelligence manager at Corvus, a cyber insurance company based in Boston. On itssecurity tips page, Corvus provides education on OOBA along with employee awareness, multifactor authentication, email security and logging — all of which can be applied to deepfake prevention and education. For example, the same prevention recommendations on wire-transfer fraud should apply to social engineering through deepfakes, but preventing deepfake-initiated scams from succeeding may need to be explicitly stated in the insurance policies. The other issue is how to protect the voice, likeness, interests, and expressions of CEOs and other executives who can be scooped and input into the generative AI program to create the deepfakes, Bell says. Since it’s impossible to keep these people off the web, then organizations will need to tune their dark web and external threat intelligence to look for precursors to deepfake creation. Employee awareness training will only go so far as deepfakes get more realistic and interactive with AI-generated images, trained facial expressions, and manipulated voices. Take, for example, work-from-home deepfake interviewees, which the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)started warning about in 2022. At some point, it becomes impossible for the HR person to identify the fake, so deepfake detection and verification tools will become an important tool in the employer’s arsenal. “There are programs that can detect if a person is live or fake by way of blood flow, movements, background, and more criteria, taking a recorded or live image down to the pixel level. These services look for signs of fakes that are largely undetectable at the human level,” says Geoff Kohl, a senior director at the Security Industry Association (SIA) who authored a paper on the impact ofdeepfakes on cybersecurity programsthat includes interviews with SIA members. “Today’s emerging deepfake detection solutions are largely delivered as standalone software, but for these offerings to scale and become available to businesses everywhere, it is inevitable that these software solutions will be offered as cloud-based services.” Work is underway on open-source standards to assist viewers and security tools in verifying the authenticity of an image. Microsoft’s Video Authenticator was built and tested on data sets prior to its release in 2020, and Microsoft concedes that the model will not hold up to advances in generative AI. And, since 2021, policy groups have been talking about contextualization engines to determine the realness of online media including images and voice, and companies like Google are announcing new tools to detect fakes in image search results. A handful of API and browser-based plugins are also emerging to detect the ‘aliveness’ of videos in social media. And while these tools may serve media companies and social media users, they seem to neglect the key channels where deepfakes can impact business, government, and critical infrastructure agencies, such as over voicemail, e-mail, Zoom, Slack, or other common business communication channels. Based on their lack of readiness for generative AI at the April 2023 RSA Security Conference, don’t expect traditional security vendors to fill this space any time soon. So, a new breed of cloud-based detection and inspection services will likely emerge to serve enterprises in the future. For the most part, organizations will need to focus on requirements that are in their cyber insurance policies. Since most policies call for multifactor authentication as a prerequisite for granting coverage, Ferrini of McGowanPRO suggests that business users need to strengthen these capabilities across their organizations. So, if deepfakes are used to thwart biometric access controls, a second form of authentication would help protect against unauthorized access. Wendy Esposito, the lead of the GenAI Commission at Benesch Law, an AmLaw 200 firm with offices in the US and China, advises CISOs to review their cyber liability policies regularly, even quarterly or semi-annually if possible. “Organizations should be looking at their policies now to understand what is and is not covered, because technology and cyber threats are changing so quickly. CISOs should pick up that document regularly and hold discussions with risk, legal, and finance teams to measure current and future risks against potential gaps in coverage. At least annually, boards of directors need to be briefed on the organization’s cyber liability coverage and any identified gaps.” Take reputational damage coverage, for example. If financial losses are caused through deepfakes posted on social media, podcasts, YouTube, or network television or radio (such as in the case with Russia’s president), then current policies likely won’t cover them because they weren’t caused by a breach of the company’s network or systems, she adds. Esposito has seen many policies on behalf of her clients, and they only cover such losses if they were caused by network penetration or a cyberattack. Inversely, if the attackers use deepfakes to phish an employee and then install ransomware on company systems, then under certain policies that would probably be covered because it involves an intrusion — so long as the proper email security controls and user training programs are actively in place (and those programs will need to be deepfake aware).  It’s through this lens that CISOs and insurers will need to reexamine existing policy requirements and their technical controls. Esposito predicts that deepfake-related losses will be added onto cyber insurance policies, but for additional costs to the insured, adding that “cyber liability insurance is very expensive and deepfake coverage will likely add to that expense.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS Critical remote code execution flaw patched in Veeam backup servers Signal

How CISOs are approaching staffing diversity with DEI initiatives under pressure Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  As a technologist and cybersecurity researcher, Erik J. Huffman is well-versed in hacker tricks. Yet Huffman nearly fell victim to a scam after receiving an email purportedly from his mother asking for financial help. The email immediately reminded him of how much his mother had done for her family. He says he heard her voice in his mind as he read the words on the computer screen. And although Huffman knew she had never before asked for money, he quickly replied: “How much do you need?” It wasn’t until another email came back, asking how quickly he could send money — another uncharacteristic ask — that Huffman questioned the exchange. “Some red flags had been raised,” Huffman says as herecounted the story in his TED Talk, titled “Human Hacking: The Psychology Behind Cybersecurity.” In both his TED Talk and in a follow-up interview with CSO, Huffman explains why he almost fell for the scam: he could hear his mother’s voice in his head as he read the email, which made the request seem real. He wanted to be helpful. And, in the rush of the everyday, he didn’t pick up on the danger right away. He’s not alone in those reactions. Huffman and other cybersecurity leaders say they’re a typical part of the human DNA, which hasn’t yet evolved to trigger the flight-or-flight response when encountering online dangers. That reality has spurred a growing interest in how the science of human behavior can inform and improve the discipline of cybersecurity. Authorities in this space say the interest is warranted. “People act in ways that are unpredictable, so while it’s great to have multifactor authentication and other security technologies, it only takes one person to respond to one email on one day to put the organization at risk,” says Lee Hadlington, a senior lecturer in cyberpsychology at Nottingham Trent University, a chartered psychologist and a member of the university’s cyberpsychology research group. “That’s the human factor side in cybersecurity, and it’s something CISOs have to start thinking more about.” Cyberpsychologists and enterprise cybersecurity practitioners both stress the need to better understand how people interact with technology to create a stronger cybersecurity posture. They point to statistics showing that most breaches involve some sort of human misstep.Verizon’s 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report, for example, found that “74% of all breaches include the human element, with people being involved either via error, privilege misuse, use of stolen credentials or social engineering.” As Huffman says, hackers “don’t want to go toe-to-toe with your firewall. They don’t want to challenge your antivirus, because that’s very difficult, not when they can exploit the largest vulnerability on every network on the planet right now — that’s us, people. Cybercriminals are not just hacking computers; they are hacking humans. Because … unlike computers, we actually respond to propaganda.” Psychology gets at why humans do what they do, says Huffman, founder of cybersecurity services firm Handshake Leadership. There are multiple psychological reasons why people fall for phishing schemes and other hacker scams, according to Huffman, Hadlington and others looking at the role of human nature in cybersecurity. For a start, many workers click when they shouldn’t because they’re focused on their job. “They’re thinking, ‘I’m just trying to get my job done. I want to get my boss off my back,’” Hadlington says. “Or it’s just an accident: They thought they were doing the right thing,” he says, adding that most people want to be helpful when receiving a request at work. At the same time, workers haven’t been conditioned to be wary of strangers online; they don’t think “stranger danger” as they would in real life, Huffman says. And people still have the tendency to think that they won’t be scammed. “They have plausible deniability. They think, ‘It won’t happen to me, and the less I think about it, the less I’ll be a target,’” Hadlington explains. The hackers understand all that, says Stephanie Carruthers, chief people hacker at IBM. She says they frequently design attacks that create a feeling of fear, a sense of urgency or an aura of authority to get people to react. That’s why a message like “You’ll lose your benefits if you don’t complete these forms today” is effective, Carruthers says. A message like that hijacks the reader’s amygdala — the portion of the brain that detects and responds to threats. “You’re reacting really fast,” she says. “And when you have those strong emotions, you stop looking at the red flags.” Applying the science of psychology tocybersecurityhelps cybersecurity professionals understand where, how, and why they’re falling short in building a security program that works, experts say. “We need to design security with people in mind because if security doesn’t work for people, it just doesn’t work,” says John Blythe, a behavioral scientist and director of cyber workforce psychology at Immersive Labs, maker of a cybersecurity training platform. Blythe points to password requirements as a case in point: requiring complex combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols as well as mandating frequent changes, taxes workers’ memories so they end up using weaker passwords (and writing them down) so they can get into the systems needed to do their work. (That’s why, he says, asking workers to use three random words “works best for human memory” as well as security. TheUK’s National Cyber Security Centrereinforces that point, noting that three-word passwords are “long enough” and “strong enough” for most purposes.) Huffman cites another example where the science of psychology shows where security might be working against itself, explaining that security practitioners who say “it’s notifthere’s a breach, butwhen” (or some variation of that) may actually be doing more harm than good. He says it has to do with the Pygmalion effect, a psychological phenomenon in which settinghigh expectations leads to higher performance while setting low expectations gets low results. “When we say ‘it’s notif, butwhen,’ we’re taking the control away from the user,” Huffman says. He asks: What’s the incentive for users to follow best practices, especially when those practices require extra effort, if they’re being told it won’t necessarily matter? “Instead, give every user power and control [by saying]: ‘We can stop these attacks. We can overcome this. We will not get attacked because we will follow the right processes,’” Huffman adds. As CEO and founder of RevolutionCyber, Juliet Okafor helps organizations move from cybersecurity awareness to adoption and offers fractional business information security officer (BISO) services. Okafor, who is also an attorney with a background in communications, focuses on the human component of building a cyber-resilient organization. She says she draws on marketing and sales principles that convince people to make a purchase or take an action. “They’re selling someone on making a decision they wouldn’t normally make. Cybersecurity is the same. You’re convincing people that cybersecurity is part of their job. And to do that, cyber must use psychology. It demands psychology for it to be effective,” Okafor says. Like a marketing professional, Okafor has developed and uses personas to help her fine-tune the cybersecurity messages she delivers to individuals. Those personas consider their roles, their motivations, how they prefer to learn and other factors. “When we do this, we can personalize campaigns, we build better awareness and we better mitigate risks,” she says. Okafor says cyberpsychologists have also used their training to identify enterprise vulnerabilities. She points to research that shows how people’s more-rushed behaviors at certain times of day, such as just before lunch and right before leaving, make them more prone to click through emails including phishing attacks. (Cyberpsychologists call such rushed moments a “hot” visceral state.) Security teams that understand this dynamic can act on that information, she says, for example by adjusting its security information and event management (SIEM) platform to create more gates for emails to travel through during those times. Okafor has also applied psychology to training security teams, having worked with companies looking to improve their incident response times. She used competitions to train teams and asked winners to share their strategies — the former leveraging security workers’ typically competitive nature and the latter leveraging their motivations to do good and be seen as trusted stewards. As she explains: “It’s taking what you know about how people work and creating policies to make sure the right controls are in place.” Christie Wilson, cyber resilience manager with UniSuper, says she, too, is bringing psychology into her organization’s security program.  Wilson, who has both a bachelor’s degree and a post-graduate diploma in sociology, says she’s working to “analyze and predict human interactions, motivations, and vulnerabilities, which are important considerations for protecting against cyber threats and designing effective security measures.” Wilson says this has helped her develop awareness training that better resonates with people and helps them better understand why they need to buy into the company’s cyber resilience program. This mindset has even brought Wilson to adjust her thinking around people as “the weakest link. “People aren’t the weakest link,” she notes. “They are the primary attack vector. It’s important we understand this when creating awareness and training content. As security professionals, we need to put ourselves in our people’s shoes. Security might be the most important thing in the world to us, but for others it can be anything from a blocker to something they never consider.” She adds: “Understanding that behavior change needs motivation, ability, and prompts has been a key component of our cyber resilience program.” Blythe says the most effective way for CISOs to incorporate psychology into their security program is to bring a cyberpsychologist on board, saying “A cyberpsychologist would know what the science is and how it works.” Others agree, but they acknowledge that’s a big ask —and one that’s hard to do. For one thing, there are few people trained in the discipline. Cyberpsychology, which focuses on how the mind reacts when people interact with technology, is still a relatively new field, Hadlington says. Moreover, not all cyberpsychologists and cyberpsychology programs focus on cybersecurity. CISOs already working with slim budgets may not have the money for such a position. Still, interest and information about the intersection of psychology and cybersecurity is spreading. Hadlington is taking a “train the trainer approach.” Huffman researches and speaks on the topic. And institutions are adding courses in this space; for example, the SANS Institute, a training organization, is running aManaging Human Risk Summitin August 2023, which will address in part the psychology factor. Experts say CISOs can learn to layer psychology into their security programs to boost the effectiveness of their work. To start with, Hadlington and Huffman both recommend that CISOs engage in more communication. They should ask workers about where they struggle with security controls, why they circumvent security policies, why they clicked on the link in a simulated (or real) phishing scam, what would motivate them to be more security-minded, etc.  Then they should address those human elements. CISOs should also empower workers with ways to solve their challenges and also clearly articulate the ways workers make a difference in security. “That feedback loop is really critical,” Hadlington says. “People want to know ‘Why am I doing this? What’s in it for me? Am I helping the organization? Is what I’m doing effective?’” Additionally, Huffman says CISOs can work with their marketing teams to learn techniques for influencing behavior. And, as marketing does with the messages it sends to its audience, Huffman says security can personalize security awareness and training. CISOs can also work with their executive colleagues to address cultural issues that foster that psychological hot state, Huffman says, noting that a workplace where employees are constantly worried or unreasonably busy “gives hackers another advantage.” Lance Spitzner, director of research and community at the SANS Institute, says he advises CISOs to take a broader view of this topic, applying psychology and behavioral sciences to affect not just individual workers but organizational behavior as a whole. “You’re trying to create an environment in which humans exhibit strong security behaviors,” he says. “To secure organizations, we need to secure people. And to secure people, we need to change their behaviors. And to change their behaviors, we need to both motivate and empower them to change. That’s where the cognitive sciences come in.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS New phishing campaign uses scareware to steal Apple credentials Trump shifts cyberattack readiness to state and local governments in wake of info-sharing cuts CISOs are taking on ever more responsibilities and functional roles - has it gone too far?

Many organizations, including the US Federal Government and the Department of Defense (DoD), utilize CVSS severity scores to help drive their vulnerability remediation timeline requirements. The introduction of the EPSS, which attempts to aid vulnerability prioritization efforts by providing a numerical score of how likely a vulnerability is to be exploited over the next 30-day window, has been a boon to security practitioners and organizations looking to improve their vulnerability management activities. Studieshave shown that organizations can only remediate between 5% and 20% of their vulnerabilities each month, leaving them in a situation where they are perpetually falling behind the number of published and emerging vulnerabilities due to their inability to remediate them all. Organizations ultimately aim to take approaches to prioritize vulnerabilities for remediation, but they have historically been very inefficient and ineffective, all at a time when we constantly hear about the shortfall of cybersecurity talent and organizations struggling to attract and retain it. It has beenfoundthat using only a CVSS severity score to measure the risk of an individual vulnerability is equivalent to picking random vulnerabilities to fix, whereas focusing on vulnerabilities with actual exploitation proof or probability is far more effective at mitigating organizational risks. A common vulnerability prioritization strategy called for in sources such as PCI and Federal vulnerability management guidance is to remediate vulnerabilities within a predefined set of calendar days after initial detection, based on CVSS severity scores. This often manifests in havingcriticalandhighvulnerabilities (as categorized by CVSS) prioritized for remediation within seven to 30 days of initial detection. On the surface, this seems intuitive, except for the issue that fewer than 10% of known vulnerabilities are actuallyeverexploited in the wild. For example, security vendor Qualys found in their 2023TRURISK Threat Reportthat despite there being 25,000 known vulnerabilities published to the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD) in 2022, fewer than 5% of those were ever actually known to be exploited in the wild. While organizations may prioritize vulnerabilities based on CVSS severity scores, those vulnerabilities may not be known to be exploited through sources such as CISA’sKnown Exploited Vulnerability (KEV)list, and they mayneverbe known to be exploited. Organizations are essentially spending precious time and resources remediating vulnerabilities that pose little to no risk while ignoring those that potentially do. As an industry, we desperately need to focus on vulnerabilities that pose the most risk and those that are the most likely to be exploited are great places to start. That’s where EPSS comes in, and the EPSS 3.0 model provides a number of improvements over previous versions. The best way to really dig into EPSS 3.0 and the evolution of EPSS overall is with thelatest whitepaperproduced by the EPSS special interest group members from organizations such asCyentiaandRAND. The EPSS team claims an 82% performance improvement in EPSS 3.0 over previous versions along with covering the evolving vulnerability landscape. The NISTNational Vulnerability Database (NVD)has continued to see exponential growth with a 24.3% increase in vulnerabilities in 2022 over 2021, totalling more than 25,000 vulnerabilities in a single year. Despite the tremendous growth of vulnerabilities, organizations only have a median remediation rate of 15.5% with one-quarter of organizations remediating fewer than 7% of their open vulnerabilities per month. This creates a scenario in which organizations are perpetually drowning in increasing vulnerability backlogs, with some studies finding the average organization has a backlog of more than 100,000 vulnerabilities and climbing. EPSS strives to help organizations prioritize vulnerabilities quickly by focusing on those with the highest probability of being exploited over the next 30 days. EPSS boasts the ability to help organizations minimize the burden of patching critical vulnerabilities with one-eighth of the effort of typical strategies using CVSS. EPSS utilizes a variety of sources when it comes to exploits, such as Fortiguard, Alienvault OTX, the Shadow Server Foundation, and GreyNoise, all of which utilize various techniques to identify exploitation attempts in digital environments around the globe. In addition to these sources, EPSS utilizes over 1,400 features for predicting exploitation activity. These include sources such as published exploit code, public vulnerability lists, offensive security tools, and the age of the vulnerability among others. To prove their performance improvements with EPSS 3.0, the EPSS special interest group performed testing to explore the increased effectiveness of the 3.0 model. They measured its performance improvement in predicting vulnerability exploitation over 30 days using the features discussed above and they compared performance results and metrics against previous EPSS versions such as 1 and 2, as well as CVSS v3 base scores. One diagram that demonstrates the significant improvement is found below, which shows all CVEs, CVEs above a threshold, and those that are actually exploited. As you can see, when contrasting CVSS v3.x along with EPSS v1 and v2, EPSS 3.0 shows a significant improvement in terms of prioritizing the largest portion of exploited vulnerabilities. The blue circles represent the number of vulnerabilities needing to be remediated under the given methodology and the red circle represents actual exploitation activity. As you can see, EPSS significantly outperformed the other models by helping users remediate the largest portion of exploited vulnerabilities and minimizing wasted resources and effort on non-exploited vulnerabilities. Strategy comparisons holding the coverage constant While the EPSS model isn’t perfect, it does present a strong data-driven approach to help organizations focus on vulnerabilities that pose the greatest threat based on probable exploitation activity. We’re also seeing an evolution of other industry resources such as the longstanding Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). It’s worth emphasizing that EPSS measures the threat associated with a published CVE, based on the probability that the CVE will actually be exploited in the wild in the next 30 days. It doesn’t account for organization-specific context such as that related to assets or the business. That said, when organizations are drowning in a backlog of hundreds of thousands of open vulnerabilities with the rate of discovered and published vulnerabilities only accelerating, starting with vulnerabilities most likely to be exploited is a great foundation.

Ukraine’s ground counteroffensive ushers in a new phase of the conflict in cyberspace,https://www.csoonline.com/article/645556/ukraines-ground-counteroffensive-ushers-in-a-new-phase-of-the-conflict-in-cyberspace.html,"Cyberattacks against Ukraine have surged, linked to attacks on the ground, but their effectiveness has been blunted, according to observers including the deputy chairman of Ukraine’s cyber warfare service.

Here’s how cyber teams can cope The most notorious and damaging ransomware of all time Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  As its campaign against Ukraine grinds on well into its second year, Russia appears to be making greater use of hacktivists, “patriotic” cybercriminals, and mercenaries in its attacks on the smaller nation. Meanwhile, Western countries neighboring Russia, including recent NATO entrant Finland, have seen an upsurge in hostile attacks that pose a threat to both businesses and government institutions. Attacks by Russia against Ukraine’s government, media outlets and utilities predate the full-scale invasion of its southern neighbor by Russian forces in February 2022, stretching back to the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Notable attacks include theNotPetya wiper malwarein June 2017 andattacks on Ukraine’s power gridin December 2015 that temporarily left about 225,000 customers without power. The latter was subsequently attributed to Sandworm, a unit of Russian military intelligence (GRU). With the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, feared attacks leading to the degradation of critical infrastructure services failed to materialize — thanks to the experience, preparations, and expertise of Ukrainian cyber-defenders. Assistance by Ukraine’s Western allies also helped to build resilience in the face of determined assaults. Cyberattacks have nonethelesscontinuedthroughout the conflict, accompanied by something of an upsurge in activity since the start of 2023. The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) handled 701 incidents between January and April of 2023, with utilities at the sharp end of attacks. About a quarter of the attacks were aimed at government agencies and the military with many of the remainder targeting the power grid, finance, transport, telecoms, and other elements of Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. This compares to 2,194 attacks logged by CERT-UA throughout the whole of 2022. The aims of Russian cyber attackers include reconnaissance (gaining information about government and public infrastructure as well as citizens), destroying infrastructure, spreading panic and distrust in local authorities, and attacking the morale of the population through disinformation and propaganda. Russian cyberattacks against Ukraine often coincide with physical strikes by rockets and missiles and drones, according to Victor Zhora, the deputy chairman and chief digital transformation officer of the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine (SSSCIP). “In some cases, we observe the coordination between cyberattacks and kinetic attacks,” Zhora says. “For instance, some cyberattacks can be disruptive to [elements of the] critical infrastructure, such as telecoms. In some cases, these attacks can amplify the psychological effect of kinetic attacks.” Information harvested through hacking can be used as intelligence to direct conventional (kinetic) attacks. “There are many forms of how these attacks can be really harmful and can be useful in conventional warfare,” Zhora says. “Of course, the impact of these attacks cannot be compared to the disruptions provided by conventional warfare.” During the conflict, Ukraine’s defence minister famously called for international support from hackers in targeting Russian entities, leading onto the creation of the “IT Army of Ukraine”, a band of Ukrainian and foreign volunteers. This syndicate has had a significant impact in disrupting Russian entities, including conducting DDoS attacks, doxing Russian military members and senior officials, conducting defacement attacks, and data breaches. The IT Army of Ukraine has also played a significant role in PsyOps (psychological warfare) and in raising awareness of the reality of the conflict among Russian citizens, many of whom have had their access to real-time information censored by the Russian state. Russia, meanwhile, has established a hacktivist community under the name Killnet which has had some success in conducting disruptive attacks against institutions in Ukraine and NATO countries. This has mostly involved the use of DDoS attacks, which while being successful in causing disruptions, have not had a lasting impact. Other groups supporting Russia includeCyber Front Z, a pro-Russian troll operation, andNoName057, a group largely associated with running DDoS attacks against the websites of utilities and telecoms firms in pro-Ukranian countries. A wiper calledAcid Rainaffected routers and modems, including 5800 wind turbines in Germany on 24 February 2022. Cybersecurity experts tell CSO that the Russian state has some level of involvement in influencing hacktivist and cybercriminal operations, but its level of involvement is unclear. Many pro-Russian hacktivist groups that claim to carry out attacks on Russia’s enemies are, in fact, fronts for various Russian government agencies, security experts suspect. For example, the FreeCivilian data extortion group has conducted several attacks that have resulted in the deliberate breaching of data on Ukrainian government websites. While those running the operation have claimed to be an independent cybercriminal (or group), there are several similarities with defacement activity that was attributed to advanced persistent threat (APT) groups associated with Russian military intelligence (GRU). “It is realistically possible that FreeCivilian is instead operated by GRU members,” according to Chris Morgan, senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at ReliaQuest. A member of the“Yanluowang” ransomware groupwas also doxxed as a member of the Russian Armed Forces. “With threat actors deliberately attempting to obfuscate their identity and motivations — often by masquerading as a separate entity — determining where activity sits on the spectrum of attribution is incredibly difficult,” Morgan says. Broadly speaking Russian military intelligence (GRU) is most involved in targeting Ukraine with destructive attacks. The Russian FSB security agency is, by contrast, targeting intelligence operations worldwide. Tactics and targets are shifting as are the cadence of attacks. “Russian cyber operations have also taken a dramatic change, with reporting suggesting that Russian state-aligned groups – notably those associated with Russia’s military intelligence, the GRU – have been changing pace to conduct quick, destructive attacks,” Morgan says. “This change involves a tactic of ‘living on the edge’ by targeting edge devices like firewalls and routers and deploying data-wiping malware in a matter of weeks after initial access. Often, victims were targeted multiple times, with motivations balanced between conducting espionage operations and conducting disruption.” Even financially motivated groups are sometimes encouraged to attack Ukrainian targets with reassurance by the Russian government that they will not be prosecuted. A recent espionage campaign by the hacking groupWinter Vivern(a group with links to the Russian and Belarusian governments) targeted government agencies and telecom operators in Europe, Ukraine, and India. Among the targets it is suspected to have attacked are Ukrainian government websites that offer guidance to Russian and Belarusian troops seeking to surrender during the war in Ukraine. “Russia’s tactics have had to change because in the past their reliance on many APT groups who were based in Russia changed,” Philip Ingram MBE, a former senior British military intelligence officer and content lead at International Cyber Expo, tells CSO. “Those APTs franchised a lot of their activities out to hackers outside Russia and their access to these individuals dried up almost completely when Russia re-invaded Ukraine in February 2022.” Russian hacktivists continue to play a nuisance role both inside Ukraine and across the rest of the world, according to Ingram. The Russian government has probably tolerated cybercriminal ransomware gangs such asREvilandConti. But in January 2022, just before the invasion of Ukraine, theycracked down on the REvil gangand arrested them. It seems that some of the cybercriminals arrested by Russia during a short-lived crackdown on ransomware operations prior to February 2022 have been released, according to Mikko Hyppönen, chief research officer at WithSecure. Over recent months, the Finland-based cybersecurity vendor has tracked an increase in the activity of pro-Russian hacktivist groups. Tim West, head of threat intelligence at WithSecure, says there has long appeared to be a relationship between Russian hacktivists and the country’s government. This month some of these hacktivists have come out self-proclaimed “private military contractors” (mercenaries), openly declaring themselves as more involved than simple self-motivated “patriotic hackers,” he tells CSO.  At present, these hacktivists are primarily involved in disruptive attacks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, ransomware and wiper malware. Most of this is fairly low level, according to West. Finland joined NATO on April 4, 2023, in a decision spurred on by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian jets have carried out incursions into Finnish airspace since Finland first applied to join the Western defence alliance. The country’s accession to NATO has been accompanied by a ramp-up in DDoS attacks against Finnish government organizations, according to West. “We also detected a small spike in malware activity in Finland on the days around Finland’s membership was made official.” Technical measures – such as applying software updates, redundancy and remote backups – need to be combined with processes and policies to make countries more resilient to attacks. “The Ukraine is not alone. Unfortunately, it is not the only target,” Zhora says. “We see a lot of our friends and partners being attacked by Russia.” “I think there are a lot of areas of cooperation, exchanging information on threats, sharing experience and techniques of protection,” Zhora says. “Our recommendations for all of our partners are basically the same: sharing cyber rules, building capacities, enhancing collaboration and cooperation between agencies, improving international cooperation, and strengthening existing infrastructures. I think one of the major contributions to our resilience was achieved through international technical assistance projects prior to this full-scale war.” PODCASTS VIDEOS RESOURCES EVENTS SPOTLIGHT: MANAGING MODERN RISKS Trump shifts cyberattack readiness to state and local governments in wake of info-sharing cuts SpyCloud’s 2025 Identity Exposure Report Reveals the Scale and Hidden Risks of Digital Identity Threats Attack time frames are shrinking rapidly.

Why Russia’s cyber arms transfers are poor threat predictors,https://www.csoonline.com/article/575175/why-russias-cyber-arms-transfers-are-poor-threat-predictors.html,"Sharing cyber tools and technology with nations such as Iran or North Korea has limited impact without also providing operational and organizational support. The transactional backdrop of Russia’s Ukraine missteps Cyber operations are much more than tools or exploits The strategic calculus: how much Russian cyber operations help is too much? When to become concerned about Moscow and Tehran in cyberspace Related content Trump shifts cyberattack readiness to state and local governments in wake of info-sharing cuts Chinese cyberespionage group deploys custom backdoors on Juniper routers Chinese APT Silk Typhoon exploits IT supply chain weaknesses for initial access The risks of standing down:  Why halting US cyber ops against Russia erodes deterrence Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  The history of international cyber conflict is remarkably long and storied. The timeline of major cyber threat events stretches back nearly four decades, but it is really only the last decade that has seen thewidespread proliferation of national cyber forces. As of 2007, only 10 countries had operational cyber commands, three of which were members of the NATO alliance. Just eight years later, that figure jumped to 61 nations, a full two-thirds of which were outside of the NATO alliance. Clearly, national governments have become more willing to see cybersecurity as a key responsibility. States are alsocooperating and sharingthe burden of securing cyberspace. Against the backdrop of cyber partnerships aimed atimproving the common health of the digital domain, some countries are collaborating to build better offensive capabilities. A highly visible recent example of this—Russia’s initiative to furnish Iran with new digital surveillance and intrusion capabilities—has generated substantial concern among Western commentators.Somesee the transfer of cyber arms as another instance of Russia’s wartime troubles leading to the sophistication of partners that it relies on for battlefield matériel—countries like China, Iran, and North Korea. On the surface, these concerns seem well-founded. The spread of Russian arms and munitions in decades past has fueled the potential for conflict in hotspots around the world. The spread of Russian cyber tools might surely do the same. But this view misses key facts about what constitutes robust offensive cyber operational capabilities. In many ways, exploits and tools are the least important elements of a competent offensive posture online. Talent, infrastructure, operational know-how, and organizational support make the difference between irritating threat actors and truly dangerous ones. Not only is Moscow not offering these elements up—yet—but Putin’s government also has clear strategic reasons to limit its cyber cooperation. Between 2011 and 2013, in the wake ofrevelations in the international communityabout Stuxnet and the cyber-physical attack on the Natanz uranium enrichment facility, Iranian cyber warriorslaunched a series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attackson financial targets across the Middle East and the West. Since that time, however, Iran’s commitment to becoming a capable cyber power has meantless focus on such direct disruption. Instead, the government in Tehran has been tied to increasingly sophisticated disinformation campaigns, supply chain attacks, and attempts to infiltrate critical infrastructure systems in Europe and North America. For some, this shift in approach has clear ties to the series of cyber cooperation agreements signed by Iran and Russia over the past decade. These agreements appear to have been focused on bolstering network defense capabilities. However, recent developments suggest that cyber collaboration between Tehran and Moscow may have evolved toward offense. Recently,the Wall Street Journal reportedthat Russia is directly helping Iran build its cyber offense abilities via the provision of surveillance tools, hacking software, and know-how about methods of exploitation for a range of common consumer products. One transfercomes from the Russian company PROTEI Ltd., which has provided Iranian authorities with censorship software.According to Citizen Lab, the tools developed by PROTEI and delivered to an Iranian ISP would “enable state authorities to directly monitor, intercept, redirect, degrade, or deny all Iranians’ mobile communications, including those who are presently challenging the regime.” Cyber cooperation between the two authoritarian regimes clearly has a domestic flavor. Both governments have illustrated in both statement and action that social control is a top priority. Yet in both countries, development of the infrastructure of population control has been enmeshed with the construction of operational capabilities for foreign interference and attack. One need look no further than PROTEI to see this, as the company is known to hold extensive contracts with Russia’s Ministry of Defense. Iran has also quite famously leveraged surveillance techniques to address state interests beyond its borders. In addition to extensive efforts to usemalware to spy on journalistsand advocates abroad, Tehran has been linked to major cyberattacks like the2011 compromise of certificate authority DigiNotar, whose compromise likely gave the regime access to thousands of dissident email accounts. Beyond shared authoritarian and strategic interests, of course, this development in the relationship is also likely being driven by Russia’s persistentmissteps on the battlefield in Ukraine. Aside from the seeming inability of Moscow’s armies to capture and hold territory in the face of tenacious Western-backed Ukrainian defensive efforts, recent months have underlined the logistical bankruptcy of Vladimir Putin’s campaign. Russia’s stockpiles of munitions, armored vehicles, and even basic supplies have been depleted so extensively that the regime is now turning to partners for resupply and even for new capabilities. Iranian drones have featured heavily in Moscow’s aerial campaign against Ukraine’s people and the government in Tehran has been reaping the benefits thereof. American equipment captured from Ukrainian forces has found its way into Iranian hands. Russia is also selling natural gas at a steep discount to Iran as well as to India, China, and other third parties to the conflict. Now, cyber tools are enhancing the Islamic Republic’s capacity to spy, compromise, and disrupt online. Given this development, the bottom line for many is that closer Russo-Iranian cooperation on building offensive capacity in cyberspace portends heightened insecurities for Western industry in the future. While there is certainly a base level of concern about this evolution the partnership, the degree to which this development fuels the threat to the West shouldn’t be overblown. Just as nuclear weapons cannot be obtained via the theft of simple formulas or even fissile material, the sale or transfer of “cyber weapons” (e.g., code, exploits, or tools) rarely amounts to anything more than a minor improvement of capability. To catapult Iranian cyber capacity to the next level, Russia would have to bring much more to the table. Specifically, the degree to which exploits and tools are only made relevant in the context of robust organizational process, talent support, and infrastructure is often underemphasized in those commenting on state cyber operations. Max Smeetshas notedthat the workforce required to underwrite even competent offensive cyber operations is extensive. In addition to the operators, vulnerability analysts, and basic technical support staff that enact digital intrusion, cyber forces require testing personnel, tactical planners, system administrators, and frontline support staff. Without these supporters, cyber operators would have limited access to the resources—often drawn from black market engagement, other intelligence outfits, or private industry coordination—needed to succeed in strategically meaningful ways. Not mentioned yet are the regular support staff found in any organization (e.g., human resources or legal support) and the political planners that must figure out how to employ cyber offensive assets to fit broader geopolitical strategies. Added to this workforce complexity is the fact that robust, innovative capacity in any organization is a product of culture and vision. Even if cyber operators often function with less tactical oversight than a regular soldier might,effectivedecision-making means understanding how the organization and the political interests it serves set priorities. To some degree, this is a matter of doctrine but it’s also a matter of tacit knowledge foundations. Tacit knowledge, which underwrites organizational culture and sets shared understandings of the mission involved, is information that is hard to communicate to those outside the organization. That certain tools should be avoided or emphasized around certain targets is something that a team of operators may know well, but that motivation to align tactical actions with long-term planning and political objectives is not something that can be learned quickly. Finally, effective offensive cyber capacity means developing and securing infrastructure. Cyber forces rely on robust command and control (C2) infrastructure to operate in strategically meaningful ways. This C2 infrastructure must be diverse and intentionally fragmented to allow for redundancy, plausible deniability, and the ability to burn assets (e.g., a counter-compromised server) as a vulnerability. Cyber forces also need even more extensive fallback infrastructure that permits the preparation of campaigns and is as separate as possible from C2 resources. In this space, hacking outfits can retool, train, simulate new environments, and dissect the bounties of successful operations. Iran, of course, has much of this complex infrastructure that underwrites cyber operational capacity already. However, these interacting features of a robust offensive cyber posture generally don’t plug and play as states cooperate and transfer individual elements across borders. Cooperation on the level being reported by the Wall Street Journal is unlikely to produce more than incremental benefits for Tehran. Harnessing newfound access to extensive Russian cyber warfare know-how in the wake of the Ukraine war will require immense adaptation on the part of Iran’s security services. That’s if Moscow will even agree to share more significant elements of its cyber portfolio, such as vendor relationships and talent. The transfer of cyber operational capacity is a unique beast. Like conventional arms transfer, the trade of cyber tools can look more or less complete in its immediate utility. Sometimes states transfer completed applications, infrastructure, or workforce plans. Other times, they only transfer basic training or engineering know-how and leave partners to synthesize end products on their own. Cyber tools are also, as some have noted, rivalrous goods. This means that when one actor possesses or uses them, their utility for other actors diminishes. Here, the value of cyber know-how, infrastructure, exploits, and toolsis time limited. Zero-day vulnerabilities are perhaps the best example of this dynamic, as the possibility of defender discovery of a previously unknown flaw could happen at any time. This motivates rapid use of such exploits, as well as rapid sale by those who find flaws and recognize that value is based on secrecy.The transitory nature of cyber assetsis also driven by other factors, including the similarity of new tools to existing ones, political interests in certain effects, and the likelihood of discovery (of, say, C2 infrastructure previously employed). This dynamic motivates cyber arms transfers when two states align on the precise details of planned operations, such as in the case of Israel and the United States’ coordination for Operation Olympic Games. Other than that, cyber arms transfers only make sense when the supplier isn’t made more vulnerable or less capable by supplying specific capabilities to a partner. In the current case of cooperation with Iran, Russia’s provision of tools and infrastructure centered on surveillance and targeted espionage thus makes a great deal of sense. In addition to paying the Iranians back for kinetic resupply and showing solidarity with a fellow authoritarian regime, Moscow has thus far limited its support in ways that protect the country’s core claim to cyber fame—its capacity to launch the full range of offensive cyber operations leveraging an immensely diverse array of operational units, both government and private. Simply put, Tehran’s deployment of these newfound abilities is not likely to blunt the effectiveness of Russia’s most capable digital weapons or further reveal the clandestine extent of the complex ecosystem of parts it relies on to project cyber power. Commentators must be clear when discussing developments like the recent transfer of cyber tools from Russia to Iran. Thisisa clear trade of valuable capacity to Tehran in exchange for substantial supply chain support. This isnota game-changer for Iran’s ability to plan and execute sophisticated offensive cyber operations. It isnota signal that Russia is engaging Iran as a more equal partner than in the past, as has been suggested about Moscow’s evolving relationship with Beijing. And it isnota partnership that is likely to evolve toward more extensive joint planning and execution of cyberattacks. As tempting as it is to make these assumptions, the techno-infrastructural and political context of the relationship simply don’t support them. There are three conditions under which Western industry and government stakeholders should get more concerned about this cyber relationship: Direct evidence of greater coordination of cyber activities should shift the risk calculation made by cyber defenders, specifically toward weighting areas of shared interest more heavily than alternatives. Coordination could come in several different forms, including direct operational entanglement of the kind that produced Stuxnet a decade ago. It might also look like Iranian engagement of targets that either directly or symbolically relate to the Ukraine conflict. The most obvious near-term point of concern in such a case is likely the forthcoming US 2024 election cycle, which will inevitably be targeted by Iran for interference purposes in some fashion. The form and scope of that interference, however, will be telling of just how the relationship with Moscow continues to evolve. Related to this intersectionality of Russian and Iranian geostrategic interests, Western stakeholders should be concerned if the transfer ofknownoperational capabilities for cyber activities beyond surveillance is reported. Moscow may have an interest in keeping Iran in a junior partnership role, but the transfer of tools or infrastructure with known attributes makes sense if a clear use case can be articulated by Tehran. Finally, and most significantly, the nature of the cyber partnership between Russia and Iran may change in reference to rising tension between Tehran and the West. Specifically, the transfer calculus is sensitive to circumstances in which Russia perceives a geopolitical advantage to a temporary improvement of Iran’s capabilities. If a confrontation with Iran on the part of the United States, Israel, or some other formation of Western interests can distract attention from the war in Ukraine, change the calculus of Chinese support for Russia, or impact global commodity prices, then the value proposition of more sophisticated support for Tehran might radically change. Until that point, however, Russian support for Iran’s cyber ambitions is little more than Vladimir Putin’s pre-war boasts about the superiority of Russia’s military: cheap talk.

11 security tools all remote employees should have,https://www.csoonline.com/article/571051/11-security-tools-all-remote-employees-should-have.html,"Compromised employee personal devices and accounts can disrupt and possibly threaten business security. Getting these tools into their hands will help. 11 top security tools for remote workers Cybersecurity training Digital wallets Credit/digital identity monitoring Password managers Two-factor tokens Antimalware software VPN services Backup solutions Privacy screens Computers and mobile devices Networking hardware Related content Developers: apply these 10 mitigations first to prevent supply chain attacks Generative AI red teaming: Tips and techniques for putting LLMs to the test Trump nominates cyber vet Sean Plankey for CISA chief amid DOGE cuts and firings The state of ransomware: Fragmented but still potent despite takedowns Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  It’s no secret that humans are the biggest vulnerability to any corporate network. Whether it’s an inability to properly manage password complexity across multiple systems, poor social media habits, or even a lack of awareness with things like email links, online shopping, or app and software usage. A major problem for businesses, particularly in a post-COVID world with so many people working remotely, is the fact that these security challenges employees face extend very easily to their personal devices, while your visibility and control as corporate IT does not. This potential weakness has precedent as a recent compromise of LastPass was attributed to thecompromised home computer belonging to a devops engineer. The trick of course is finding a way to help employees protect themselves as a means to better protect corporate resources while maintaining a budget and avoiding invasions of privacy. One way to do that is to encourage employee use of personal security tools like those listed below. Organizations might even pay for them or offer incentives for employees to purchase on their own. Cybersecurity training Digital wallets Credit/digital identity monitoring Password managers Two-factor tokens Antimalware software VPN services Backup solutions Privacy screens Computers and mobile devices Networking hardware Okay, calling training a tool may be a stretch, but hear me out. Many companies already have some form of cybersecurity training but getting employees to realize the risk involved with their personal life and finances is a tall task. Consider the payoff: Having employees invested in protecting their own digital lives results in having corporate interests protected as a significant side benefit. Some vendors offer cybersecurity training at varying price ranges and with different focus areas. A major area of focus in your training tools should be helping sell the value of proper digital habits to an employee’s personal well-being and getting your employees invested in protecting themselves online. Increasing employee awareness into their personal security posture is foundational to any tools or services you may put into place, making periodic training is incredibly important to protecting corporate interests. While not traditionally considered security tools, digital wallets can be useful from a security standpoint for a couple of reasons. For one, the less an individual goes in and out of their physical wallet, the less opportunity for a card to be left or another card (such as a drivers license or corporate ID) to fall out and become the basis of a compromised identity. Second, digital wallets can be used online in lieu of a credit card or as a way of establishing a profile without creating an account. Some even facilitate the creation of virtual card numbers, which can be used on web sites you don’t trust completely as a safety measure so that physical credit cards and their associated numbers remain secure. This helps minimize an individual’s digital footprint and constrains that footprint to services that maintain high levels of security. In many cases, employees will likely already have digital wallets available as part of their smartphone’s operating system (Apple Pay or Google Wallet). They just need to be educated on the value and potentially how to set it up. Most people are familiar with credit monitoring, which tracks your credit history for things like new credit cards or loans that potentially were created by criminals. Credit monitoring provides an early warning system for a compromised identity, which in turn is potentially critical for both personal and corporate security. A compromised identity can lead to malicious users having enough information about an employee that they can further compromise user email accounts or cell phones, then leverage those to compromise more critical resources like corporate accounts. Digital identity monitoring is similar, but it focuses on specific types of information, some confidential (Social Security numbers, bank account and routing numbers, or credit card numbers) and other slightly more public like email addresses and phone numbers. Monitoring services will track hacker forums and dark web sites to identify data leaks and take precautions to prevent this sensitive data from being used maliciously. The goal of monitoring digital identity is that if any account information (financial details or a username and password) becomes compromised and leaked online, you will be notified and have the opportunity to take remediation steps such as changing a password or replacing a credit card. Passwords have long been the keys to the corporate kingdom, and while businesses are taking steps to eliminate the risks involved with password-based authentication, we’re a long way from being rid of passwords. The consumer side of things is in even worse shape. Few consumer services have passwordless authentication options, and in general that’s limited to services offered by industry giants like Microsoft and Google. The next best thing is to do everything in your power to encourage proper password management: unique, complex passwords (not just special characters but with enough length to achieve sufficient entropy) for each online service. Expecting your employees to be able to manage this task on their own is a nonstarter, which leads to the requirement for a password management system. Agood password managerwill encourage good password habits, warn employees when the same password is used across multiple accounts, and even support strong passwords generated from random characters. Many times password manager services will also help monitor your digital identity, keeping a watch for compromised account credentials made available on thedark web, or warn you when services you use have been breached (prompting a password change). Ideally everyone would usetwo-factor authentication (2FA)for all critical workloads, but at minimum employees should be using an additional factor for things like email (which is itself a de facto authentication factor) and financial accounts. There are 2FA systems like time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) with which employees can simply leverage a smartphone, but there is value in hardware tokens like the Yubico Yubikey, which works with a huge array of applications and services (both web-based and local). Hardware tokens have also been found to provide stronger protection against targeted attacks than even app-based authenticators according toa Google studycomparing the success of different 2FA challenge types against different attack categories. 2FA is another area where employees should be well educated, as not all factors are created equal. SMS and email as second factors should be avoided in favor of stronger methods such as TOTP or hardware tokens. SMS and email are just too easily compromised with modern attacks to be trusted as an authentication factor. Another entry that’s a bit of a no-brainer, antimalware software helps protect employee devices from mostmalwarecategories and variants using techniques ranging from signature matching to AI-based detection. It has become clear over the last few decades that antimalware is not the end-all be-all solution to device security, but it is certainly a key component. Device-based attacks are still a popular way to steal credentials or other sensitive user data, regardless of device type or operating system. The nice thing about antimalware is that it should be trivial to convince users that it’s something they should have on their devices considering the long history of device-based attacks. VPNs are fairly ubiquitous for corporate networks these days, largely because they are relatively easy to implement, provide a measure of privacy on untrusted networks, and can allow users access to corporate resources as if they were sitting in the corporate office. Many businesses have legitimate concerns about allowing employee-owned devices connectivity to the corporate network, but there are still benefits to simply leveraging a VPN to provide a private internet connection for when your employees are using public Wi-Fi networks. If use of a corporate VPN connection doesn’t pass the sniff test, several credible consumer-focused VPN services offer similar privacy benefits to your employees without taking up any corporate resources in terms of support, hardware, or bandwidth. With the threat thatransomwarehas become, having a way to restore critical data is essential. Providing employees with a backup solution for their personal devices has obvious value if they might be performing business functions on those devices. Even if corporate policy prohibits employees from using personal devices for business use, there’s a case to be made about the stability of an employee’s personal life and the impact loss of critical data can have on an employee’s family. A potential budget alternative is a cloud storage solution that is cryptolocker-resistant, meaning it can detect a ransomware attack and protect employee files from being encrypted. If you are contemplating this route, make sure you consider the functionality you lose: automatically backing up certain files or folders on a schedule and the monitoring or reporting tools that are often available in a full backup solution. Not every problem requires a high-tech solution. Working remotely has more people using their devices in public places and using personal webcams for work meetings. Offering simple solutions like privacy screens for laptops or physical covers for web cameras can protect both employee privacy and corporate resources. These physical privacy protections are also on the very low end of the price spectrum, making them an easy win for your employees. Before you stop reading, consider the fact that corporate security always requires a balancing act between investing in security up front or risking the costs resulting from a breach later. This, along with the budgetary realities inherent in businesses large and small, typically manifests itself by large organizations prioritizing investments in security infrastructure at a much higher rate. Even small businesses should evaluate whether the risks involved with users being unmanaged and unmonitored warrants additional spending, even for a limited set of users such as executives. Purchasing devices or network hardware for your employees to use while at home provides increased security by extending the reach (and control) of corporate IT management, allowing you to keep an eye out for potential threats and nip them in the bud. Even if these devices aren’t managed as part of the enterprise, you can at least ensure your employees are using updated software and hardware that supports modern security measures like TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module 2.0), biometric authentication, and full-disk encryption. Alternatively, businesses could opt for a technology stipend to encourage employees to periodically perform technical refreshes of their mobile devices and personal computers. This doesn’t solve the problem of devices being unmanaged, but it would help ensure legacy devices with insecure operating systems get phased out periodically. Laptops and mobile devices are common investments for employee home use, but network hardware (Wi-Fi access points, router and firewalls, or other network security devices) is another area to consider as these devices are increasingly targeted by malicious entities and put all devices on the network at risk if compromised. Network hardware is also becoming more and more user friendly through mobile applications and cloud management, making it infinitely easier to leverage as a security tool. With some vendors this takes the form of spyware or antivirus protection, while some can even send alerts when a device on your network attempts to access a malicious URL or exhibits suspicious activity.

His role as CSO of Uber was something of a shift from his previous job prosecuting cybercriminals as an assistant US attorney, but closer to the tip of the cybersecurity spear. As a top-level professional in the business of defending against the bad guys, it was unexpected and not a little ironic that he would find himself on the other side of the justice system. On May 4, 2023, Sullivan wassentencedto three years of probation for felony obstruction and misprision for not reporting a 2016 breach at rideshare and delivery company Uber that threatened to expose the data of 600,000 drivers and the personal information associated with 57 million riders. In an interview with CSO, Sullivan said he’s less concerned with his personal fate than the possibility that the entire episode will cause CISOs to become more concerned about protecting themselves from aggressive prosecution than protecting their organizations. “It would be a tragedy if the outcome of this case was the opposite of what prosecutors intended, and security leaders grow more concerned about the risk to themselves than managing risk for the victims,” Sullivan tells CSO. “Our goal as a community should be for security leaders to become more empowered, more resourced, and more championed under the leadership of their companies.” Sullivan’s case has causedmuch anxiety among cybersecurity professionals, spurring fears that they themselves could face legal penalties for simply doing their jobs. But it has also galvanized the community. Sullivan stresses his gratitude for the hundreds of letters of support he received, which he says helped him through the most difficult times. His lawyers forwarded 186 of those letters to sentencing judge William Orrick, which he feels is the key reason he didn’t go to prison (although the sheer volume of letters annoyed the judge, who said at sentencing that he never received so many letters of support in past cases). The letters cited Sullivan’s exemplary record as a steadfast cybersecurity champion with a reputation for stepping into growing e-commerce companies, including eBay and Facebook, and building out their security and privacy programs. There were letters stating that Sullivan’s work at those companies had put numerous fraudsters and child predators behind bars. And they also pointed to his community service and outreach (for example, currently he is CEO of the nonprofitUkraine Friends). The letters also reveal an underlying sense of fear and confusion around the shifting issue of who is liable for the handling of breaches. Some state that, if the point of this case is deterrence (motivation to err on the side of caution in breach reporting), then, message received. Many explain how difficult the role is, how dynamic breach response can be, and the lack of clear federal guidelines for breach reporting. The excerpts below are from a single letter, “Exhibit 19,” originally dated February 27, 2023, and signed by nearly 50 cybersecurity executives: One of the signatories to that letter was Chenxi Wang, an experienced cybersecurity executive and managing partner at Rain Capital, which invests in cybersecurity startups. “This case is a wake-up call to all CISOs. And as a result, CISOs are already looking at better processes and controls for response and reporting, which is what you want to do anyway,” she says. “But you don’t want security executives fearing their jobs and responsibilities. That is a bad outcome to have happen.” In his statements at the sentencing hearing, prosecuting attorney Andrew Dawson was unsympathetic to the CISOs who wrote on Sullivan’s behalf. Pointing out the above letter, he said: “The impression is no crime occurred here. This is a tough industry, tough decisions are made, maybe this was a good-faith mistake but that’s all it was. Unless there is some rampant industrywide interest in obstruction of justice, the lessons of this case are … follow the law, follow the rules, don’t withhold information from an active, ongoing investigation.” A key point of confusion arises over when not reporting a breach becomes obstruction and misprision, especially when there is pressure on CISOs to avoid disclosing information about breaches and breach response that could create even more vulnerabilities for attackers to exploit. In a letter to the sentencing judge, Samuel Levine, director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the US Federal Trade Commission put it this way: “As a consequence of defendant Sullivan’s actions, FTC staff were forced in 2017 to reopen their completed investigation of Uber’s data security practices and renegotiate a then-pending proposed consent agreement related to a similar data breach of Uber in 2014.” Another point of confusion: why was the CSO held liable and accused of a coverup when paper trails show that Sullivan had set up an incident tracker for the response team and had informed and deferred to Uber’s CEO at the time, Travis Kalanick, and Uber attorney Craig Clark, who led Uber’s legal response to the 2016 incident? Orrick, who called this case “unprecedented,” pointed this out in court, based on the sentencing transcript. “I remain perplexed that Mr. Kalanick wrote a letter on Mr. Sullivan’s behalf, and he [Kalanick] was not present in this case. I am left with the impression that he was at least as culpable as Mr. Sullivan, and nobody brought him to court.” This question was also raised in aLaw360 legal review, published May 17, which focused on how unusual it was that neither Kalanick nor Sullivan’s in-house counsel Craig Clark appeared in court, noting that Clark received government immunity in exchange for testifying. “I’ve thought about this a lot. If you’re a person who’s never sat in the seat of the CSO, the natural conclusion is the person to blame is the person in that title,” Sullivan says. “CSOs are not holding the scale though, the CEO is. CSOs can make recommendations, but they are not the ultimate decider of that — unless we pull the parachute rope and eject ourselves from the plane as a whistleblower, which is not the option that most people are taking. Their hope is they can continue to make a difference where they’re at.” It was Clark who had recommended not reporting the breach because Sullivan’s team was able to retrieve the data before it leaked on the dark web. And that begs another question: is reporting required if the hackers were caught and their systems expunged of the sensitive data before it leaked to the dark web? The judge acknowledged Sullivan’s efforts in containing the breach and retrieving the stolen records by tricking the two hackers to sign an NDA and using that to track their IP addresses, providing evidence that was later used toconvictthe hackers of conspiracy to commit extortion. (They are now awaiting sentencing in the same district court of Northern California in which Sullivan was tried.) But the judge also said that because of the failure to report in 2016, their arrests were delayed until 2017 when the breach was reported by Uber’s new leadership. Everyone following this case has an opinion about whether Sullivan was right or wrong in the decisions he made. But as details of the case reveal, the answer is not so black and white. Sullivan’s background as a former assistant D.A., that Uber had been vilified at the time for pastscandals, and the glaring lack of federal guidance for breach reporting all had some bearing on the case and its outcome. “In fairness to CISOs, there’s not a lot of guidance about what to disclose to whom and when, and every state has a different law. These can be tough judgment calls — you’re in a bind, and it isn’t easy to figure out what to disclose to whom, especially at a company like Uber,” says Rob Chesnut, formerly chief ethics officer at Airbnb and author of the book, “Intentional Integrity: How Smart Companies Can Lead an Ethical Revolution.” Chesnut, who spent a year on Uber’s safety advisory board from 2015 to 2016, says he firmly believes “that the general counsel is the one who should be responsible for making the legal decision about whether to report a breach, and it’s strange that Uber’s general counsel claimed to know nothing even though an Uber lawyer was deeply involved, the CEO was well informed, and so much of the company’s engineering team was working on the fix to the breach.” Chesnut advises CISOs to maintain a close relationship with general counsel, and ensure that there is a group effort, including outside counsel, to make such decisions. Sullivan said as much during the sentencing hearing when he told Orrick that he should have informed general counsel, even though he, the CEO, and general counsel were all traveling on other Uber business at the time of the breach. Sullivan also admitted that he should have sought outside counsel beyond Uber’s own lawyers. Chesnut advocates having outside counsel lined up for cases like these, along with setting up a documented chain of command and then practicing reportable breach scenarios in tabletop exercises. In the early 2000s, when he was senior vice president of safety at eBay, Chesnut recruited Sullivan from the Department of Justice into a senior director role in his group. He recalls how Sullivan was personally involved in the capture and prosecution of cybercriminals trying to victimize eBay users, and how he was frequently on planes to places like Romania. Later, at Facebook, Sullivan gained a reputation for his work inchild protection, catching and testifying against numerous pedophiles who ended up serving jail time. What changed? Chesnut hypothesizes that the secretive culture at Uber may have overridden Sullivan’s inclinations. However, he adds, “The idea that Joe should be solely responsible for this is wrong. He was responsible for allowing the CEO’s decision to stand. But he was clearly scapegoated as the new incoming Uber CEO was trying to clean up Uber’s reputation in the public eye.” Uber is based in San Francisco, California, home to theconsumer privacyact.California lawrequires a business or state agency “to notify any California resident whose unencrypted personal information, as defined, was acquired, or reasonably believed to have been acquired, by an unauthorized person.” The law does not say that organizations don’t have to report if the company manages to retrieve that data before it is spread on the dark web — which was the argument Clark used and Sullivan accepted for not reporting the breach to regulators. Based on California law, Uber should have reported; if not, then Sullivan should have reported. As things turned out, it would have been much easier to be branded a whistleblower against Uber than trying to pick up the pieces of his life after a felony charge and conviction. The moment the charges were filed, his banks and insurance companies dropped him. He had to maneuver to protect his three kids who were reading about him on social media. And now, returning to the work he loves as CISO will be forever in question. “I’ve been under this anxiety for such a long time. I had underestimated the outcome at every stage. Finally, I prepared myself mentally to go to prison. And now it’s time to figure out the reality of what I can and can’t do under the terms of my probation.” Sullivan wants to use his case to rally security leaders to work together and with lawmakers to clarify reporting rules and liability and to finally draft a national data breach and reporting law. He would also like to advocate for more support and nurturing for CISOs at the board level, and in turn, promote transparency between security and leadership. As this Uber case shows, don’t expect leaders to play fair when their own reputations or their freedom is on the line. Because, as Orrick noted in the sentencing hearing: “If I have a similar case tomorrow, even if the defendant had the character of Pope Francis, they would be going to prison.” PODCASTS VIDEOS

Suite 404: Training executives for cyberattack response in a playful way,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3839258/suite-404-training-the-cyber-gau-in-a-fun-way.html,"Three IT journalists take on the roles of business execs navigating a cyberattack. Will they crack under the pressure of this fun game for introducing non-security executives to incident response? Simulation on paper The game scenario: Decision-making put to the test Easy entry — before the cardinal error of procrastination Find the hacker in the log file Additional disturbances Focus on the core problem Making targeted decisions Lessons learned Related content The 14 most valuable cybersecurity certifications Cybercriminals switch up their top initial access vectors of choice AI in incident response: from smoke alarms to predictive intelligence CISOs rethink hiring to emphasize skills over degrees and experience Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Cyberattacks are all too common in business today. If your own company is affected, quick but prudent action is required — and the C-suite suddenly must make decisions in areas they may otherwise be unfamiliar with. If executives are unprepared for such a situation and react incorrectly, the very existence of the company is quickly at stake. To avoid this, Cisco came up with “​Cyber ​​Simulator Suite 404,” atabletop scenarioto help executives learn to deal with dangerous IT incidents in a fun way. I had the opportunity recently to play Suite 404 with two IT journalist friends. Here’s what this incident response management training exercise is like and the kinds of lessons it can help executives learn aboutincident response. The first encounter with Suite 404 seems downright anachronistic. In a meeting room, there are four game boards and a number of event-based playing cards — a setting is somewhat reminiscent of the classic game Monopoly. And in the age of PDFs and the like, even the game instructions are printed on paper. Truly a throwback. But what am I actually getting worked up about here? We are training for a cyber incident in which, in an emergency, our company’s IT is at stake. And what tools would we have available in the worst case scenario? Flipcharts, paper pads, pens, and maybe even a cell phone. So the game setting may be a good fit after all. In Suite 404, we take on the role of members of the executive board who are tasked with supporting their CEO in dealing with a cyber crisis. Our company is a fictional five-star hotel group — the Vauban Hotels. Simulation of a cyber attack in the form of a classic board game. Hill The simulation itself consists of three game phases. In the first phase, seemingly everyday incidents are analyzed to determine the extent to which they have a negative impact on our hotel business. The four categories of service, reputation, sales, and cybersecurity must be taken into account. Then, using printed log files, you have to find three anomalies that give an indication of how the hackers broke into our network. In the last part of the game, you have to demonstrate your team’s decision-making skills. Here, the task is to respond clearly to a series of incidents. There is no “either,” “maybe,” or “or” as a course of action. We can only choose between two courses of action. So, everything should be easy going, right? After all, the three of us players have decades of journalistic IT reporting between us — including stories about cyberattacks. The game scenario isn’t new territory for us. Our mood was accordingly relaxed at the beginning. The task here was to assess the relevance of incidents such as a failure of the electronic door lock system in the hotel rooms or the Excel table of room bookings no longer being available. To what extent do the events affect our service, sales, our company’s reputation, and our cybersecurity? These are not complete disasters, but annoying incidents that disrupt ongoing operations. We discussed with great enthusiasm whether the respective incident had “no negative impact at all” or “maximum negative impact” on one of the four categories mentioned. This was a mistake that would later come back to haunt us. The time we wasted on trivial matters meant we later missed out on making important decisions about really critical situations. In addition, to prevent the players from becoming too comfortable, the playing time is limited to 30 minutes. This does lead to a certain level of stress at some point — but more on that later. But OK, we had mastered phase one of the game. The next step was to find the hacker who had penetrated our system. A task that can be a solvable challenge today thanks to modernintrusion detection systemsand IT forensics. Find the hacker – search the printed log files. Cisco If only the IT system was up and running to support us. In the simulation we had to make do with printouts of two pages of log files, each about A3 in size. We were supposed to discover three anomalies in these — under time pressure, because thanks to our dawdling in the first part of the game, time was running against us. Nevertheless, we managed to discover two of the three anomalies within a reasonable amount of time. However, we completely overlooked the third, actually obvious manipulation — we were simply trying too hard to think outside the box and to put ourselves in the hacker’s shoes, which might be a sophisticated approach. Or to put it another way: We didn’t see the forest for the trees. In order not to spoil the suspense for future players, we won’t reveal here which anomalies were in the log files. All I can say is that they can be found with structured thinking and sound IT basic know-how. But it is precisely these structured processes that become challenges when the game leader suddenly intervenes with another challenge: “This is the concierge, the Royal Family is complaining about an incorrect booking.” So stop studying the log files and focus on the new, current problem, and then dive back into the depths of the log files. Even in the third phase of the game, we were not spared from such disruptions — for example in the form of the event “Influencer Pretty Beauty does something stupid in the posh hotel bar and it ends up on TikTok — BBC calls and asks for a statement.” It was clear that as journalists we immediately addressed this problem. In the debriefing we were then told that this was a mistake, because at the height of the crisis it was important to concentrate only on tackling the most urgent core problems. And the third phase of the game is the catastrophe. It is certain that the IT system has been hacked and a number of incidents occur that require immediate action. The simulator always offers two options for action. All too often, you have to choose between the plague and cholera. The consequences of your own actions are also immediately shown to you with another event card. So that after a wrong decision, a feeling of frustration can certainly set in immediately. But there is no time to deal with frustration for long, especially if, like us, you wasted a lot of time in the first part of the game. Now it’s all about making decisions quickly and rigorously. All in all, we can still pat ourselves on the back. Despite mistakes, our team achieved 25 out of 30 possible points. We are also one experience richer, with some hard-earned lessons learned: Don’t get bogged down in a crisis. Commit to fast, stringent decision-making processes. Limit analysis to brief but well-founded discussions. Weigh up the consequences. Focus on core problems. Refresh basic knowledge. Practice working without supporting technologies (paper, pen). Practice for emergencies.

5 things to know about ransomware threats in 2025,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3825545/5-things-to-know-about-ransomware-threats-in-2025.html,"Attackers are shifting tactics, targeting mid-size companies and critical infrastructure sectors, while generative AI risks threaten to overshadow a focus on cyber hygiene. 1. Too much focus on generative AI risks underestimating known threats 2. Mid-size organizations are highly vulnerable 3. Data exfiltration attacks require a critical shift in security priorities 4. Heightened risks for critical infrastructure 5. Breakdown of perimeter defences Related content The state of intrusions: Stolen credentials and perimeter exploits on the rise, as phishing wanes Lesson from huge Blue Shield California data breach: Read the manual Cohesity-Veritas makes its pitch: Real-time cyberattack data recovery, AI analysis without the data lake Ransomware the most pervasive threat to US critical infrastructure in 2024, says FBI Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Ransomware attacks continue to be one of the most significant cybersecurity threats organizations and cybersecurity leaders face. Attacks lead to wide-scale disruptions, large data breaches, huge payouts and millions of dollars in costs to businesses. In response, large, coordinatedlaw enforcement operations have targeted major ransomware groupsand disrupted operations, dismantled data leak sites and seen the release of decryption keys. However, the volume of attacks has risen, the number of reported victims continues to grow and like a hydra that sprouts new heads, the ransomware ecosystem has been reformed and continues operating, although some of the tactics are changing. Here are five key insights CISOs need to know in 2025. Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT continue to cause a stir in organizations and raise a host of security concerns. However, some incident data and threat analysis suggest security leaders need to remain vigilant about the evolution of traditional ransomware tactics. Verizon’s 2024 Data Breach reportfound the volume of search terms using the word GenAI along with ransomware, malware and vulnerability in criminal forums has not moved much in the previous two years. While generative AI can amplify existing threats, it may not have moved the needle on ransomware attacks because relatively simple threat vectors such as social engineering and phishing remain effective, the report notes. Naturally, generative AI threats exist; however, the focus on new technologies risk overshadowing the importance of cybersecurity hygiene practices, especially in resource-constrained sectors like public healthcare, says Aaron Bugal, Sophos field CTO, APJ. “It can come at the expense of addressing more fundamental cybersecurity basics, which contribute to ransomware vulnerabilities.” Ransomware attack data in theSophos State of Ransomware 2024 reportshows that vulnerability management, compromised credentials, malicious email, and phishing are the most common starting points. It’s these risk factors that need to be managed through routine processes. “A lot of the attacks we’re seeing today, attackers are getting in using deficiencies in what constitutes a poorly managed or mismanaged environment and it’s just giving them the green light,” Bugal tells CSO. Not protecting credentials, lack of multi-factor authentication, not patching well-known vulnerabilities, not keeping up with aging devices and user accounts, and overlooked configurations can get put off or forgotten about if too much focus is turned to generative AI. “Some things can be trivial to discover and mitigate, but if they’re overlooked by organizations, it leaves them vulnerable to attacks,” he says. Industry data shows mid-size organizations remain highly vulnerable toransomware attacks. “CISOs need to be aware that ransomware is no longer just targeting large companies, but now even mid-sized organizations are at risk. This awareness is crucial,” says Christiaan Beek, senior director, threat analytics, at Rapid7. Companies with annual revenue around $5 million are falling victim to ransomware twice as often as those in the $30-50 million range and five times more frequently than those with a $100 million revenue, according toRapid7’s 2024 ransomware report. In 2025, the threat remains, and with many mid-sized organizations lacking a dedicated CISO, they’re more vulnerable to ransomware disruption, according to Beek. Larger organizations stand better prepared because they have a central, senior person and resources to go with it. “CISOs often have larger security teams and better tools to defend against attacks,” he says. Cyber criminals are going after these companies believing they’re large enough to hold valuable data but lack the protection of larger organizations. Meanwhile, larger organizations need to consider that supply chains and third-party partners that include smaller, mid-size outfits without a dedicated security leader can increase their exposure to risk. In the case of an attack, mid-market organizations may lack the visibility of data leaks and the forensic tools of more mature enterprises to effectively validate ransomware claims, according to Ashwin Ram, cyber security evangelist for Check Point. “Many of these organizations haven’t fully embraced external attack surface management and dark web monitoring to the same extent as the more advanced organizations.” Beek recommends CISOs conduct ransomwareattack simulationexercises at least twice a year to thoroughly assess all aspects of their incident response preparedness. “It helps identify gaps and ensure they’re ready to respond effectively,” he says. In recent years, ransomware attackers have shifted away from encryption-based extortion to data exfiltration and double-, triple and even quadruple extortion, that targets the organization and individuals and help launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, according to CheckPoint’s Ram. According todata from Coveware, 87% of observed cases in the last quarter of 2024 involved exfiltration and either leads into encryption-based attacks or is the primary objective of the attack. “Threat actors are exfiltrating sensitive data and using the threat of public exposure to force victims into paying ransoms and it’s most effective in the healthcare sector with medical records and the finance sector, where PII could facilitate financial scams and identity fraud,” says Ram. It’s changing the ransomware ecosystem. Many established cyber-criminal groups such as BianLian and Meow have adopted exfiltration techniques while new entrants such as Bashe have sprung up offering “data selling platforms”, according toCheckPoint’s 2025 State of Cyber Security report. There are numerous reasons for the changing nature of attacks. As organizations have improved their backup and recovery capabilities and law enforcement actions have disrupted attacks, bad actors have shifted their focus to data exfiltration to streamline operations, evade detection, and find other avenues for lucrative attacks, the report noted. However, without the obvious signs of data being locked up, security practitioners face the challenge of quickly determining if organizational data has been stolen and verifying any claims. In some cases, bad actors may claim a data breach by recycling information already available. “Attackers might get hold of some accounts, but they don’t have the entire organization’s credentials or they have one or two customer databases or certain customers in particular,” Ram tells CSO. Ram recommends CISOs review and strengthen their organization’s defenses around data protection, monitoring, and rapid threat detection. This requires a multi-layered approach and above all else, the organization’s “crown jewels” or most critical data assets need the highest priority. “CISOs are going to have to rewrite some of their playbooks for incident response, where that validation piece is going to play a key part,” he says. Attacks on critical infrastructure are on the rise, with energy, utilities and power infrastructure facing escalating threats and public healthcare organizations impacted in large numbers. In public healthcare, resources are usually stretched, while in others, such as manufacturing, utilities and power infrastructure, digital transformation is bringing operating systems online, creating new vulnerabilities. There is a raft of complicating factors, such as patches not being available for legacy and end-of-life technologies. “If an attacker finds a way into those industries that were traditionally offline, it presents much more of a problem,” says Sophos’ Bugal. Many organizations in the energy and utilities market tend to have older software and technologies that are more prone to security gaps. “It provides opportunities for attackers to gain access and then move laterally within environments, ultimately leading to ransomware incidents,” Bugal tells CSO. Complicating matters, as organizations grow, their IT infrastructure increases in both size and complexity and this can result in attacks, particularly those that start with an unpatched vulnerability. In the case of an attack, it’s harder for IT teams to have full visibility of all their exposures and patch before they are exploited, according to the Sophos’ report. Attacks on critical infrastructure are expected to continue into 2025, according to Arctic Wolf Labs 2025 predictions report. It also warns that while these ransomware attacks may follow the typical playbook, they can hide intrusions from hostile nation-states, potentially laying the groundwork for future digital conflict. “These incidents may have also been intended to distract from a strategic objective of establishing stealthy persistence within these environments,” the report noted. As an organization’s digital perimeter expands, the attack surface grows, with edge services and devices increasingly targeted by threat actors as entry points in ransomware attacks. The perimeter now includes IoT devices, cloud applications, VPN gateways, a host of internet connected devices and other network access tools, making it more challenging to secure access controls and monitor networks. In 2024, software vulnerabilities within devices fromPalo Alto NetworksandSonicWallwere exploited and used to launch ransomware attacks. Looking ahead, organizations can expect more threats to its attack surface, according toArctic Wolf Labs 2025 predictions report. Perimeter devices remain vulnerable to the misuse of valid accounts, exploitation of vulnerabilities, gaps in multi-factor authentication (MFA) and weaknesses in identity management practices. CISOs face increasing pressure to maintain robust patch management processes and strengthen access configurations across the board. At the same time, the expanding digital perimeter brings more exposure to zero-day vulnerabilities. The manufacturing industry remains particularly vulnerable, the report noted, accounting for 44% of all cases investigated by the lab. While advanced security technologies and tools are important, it doesn’t take away from the need to secure the organization’s digital front door, says Beek. Yet it’s an area that still has room for improvement. “We still see common security lapses, such as weak passwords on security devices or unsecured remote access that can provide an entry point for attackers,” he tells CSO. In addition, having access to insights about observed attacks helps in understanding the chain of events and the potential risks they may pose in the CISO’s own organization, according to Beek. They can then review their processes and whether there is the right technology and trained people to notice the same kind of attack. “As a CISO, if you can understand the chain of attack, you can see if there are tripwires in place and visibility of this happening in your own organization,” he says.

The dirty dozen: 12 worst ransomware groups active today,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3838121/the-dirty-dozen-12-worst-ransomware-groups-active-today.html,"Ransomware is on the rise across all industries. Here are the criminal operations cybersecurity professionals must be aware of. Akira Black Basta Blackcat (ALPHV) BlackLock Cl0p Funksec LockBit Lynx Medusa Play Qilin RansomHub Related content The state of intrusions: Stolen credentials and perimeter exploits on the rise, as phishing wanes Ransomware the most pervasive threat to US critical infrastructure in 2024, says FBI Global firms succumb to ransomware: 86% pay up despite having advanced backup tools Why Codefinger represents a new stage in the evolution of ransomware Other Sections From our editors straight to your inbox  Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) models, double extortion tactics, and increasing adoption of AI characterize the evolving ransomware threat landscape. Law enforcementtakedowns of groups such as LockBithave contributed to making the ransomware marketplace more fragmented, withemergent playersattempting to muscle in on the action. Attackers range from nation-state actors to RaaS operations, lone operators, and data theft extortion groups. The following non-exhaustive list contains a rundown of the main currently active threat groups, selected for inclusion based on their impact or innovative features. History:Akirais a sophisticated RaaS operation that emerged in early 2023 and remains active. How it works:Groups deploying Akira often exploit lack of authentication in corporate VPN appliances, open RDP (remote desktop protocol) clients, and compromised credentials to attack corporate systems. Targeted victims:The key targets are small to midsize businesses across North America, Europe, and Australia. Affected industries include manufacturing, professional and legal services, education, telecommunications, technology, and pharmaceuticals, according toPalo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 intelligence unit. Attribution:Circumstantial evidence suggests Russian origins, and links with the defunct Conti ransomware, but attribution remains unclear. “The [threat] actor gained attention due to the ‘retro aesthetic’ applied to their DLS (data leak site) and messaging,” Shobhit Gautam, staff solutions architect for EMEA at bug bounty platform HackerOne, says. History:Black Basta appeared on the ransomware scene in early 2022 and is believed to be a spin-off fromConti, a group notorious for attacking major organizations. How it works:Black Basta usually deploys malware through exploitation of known vulnerabilities and social engineering campaigns. “Employees in the target environment are email bombed and then contacted by the group pretending to be the organization’s help desk,” according to Christiaan Beek, senior director of threat analytics at Rapid7. Targeted victims:More than 500 organizations globally have been affected by Black Basta, according to ananalysis by cloud security firm Qualys. Attribution:Security researchers speculate Black Basta may be associated with the FIN7 cybercrime group due to similarities in custom modules for evading endpoint detection and response systems in malware samples. History:BlackCat, also known by the aliases ALPHV or Noberus, emerged in November 2021. It is said to be made up of former members of the now-defunct Darkside group, whichinfamously targeted the Colonial Pipeline. How it works:The malware used by BlackCat targets Windows and Linux systems. BlackCat is known for using a triple-extortion strategy, which involves demanding a ransom for file decryption, pledging not to disclose stolen data, and preventing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Targeted victims:The BlackCat (ALPHV) ransomware group has been responsible for several high-profile attacks most notablyCaesars Entertainment(September 2023) andChange Healthcare’s UnitedHealth Group subsidiary(February 2024). Attribution:The BlackCat group has gone dark, possibly in response tolaw enforcement actionand the impact of the Change Healthcare attack. Its principals, likely experienced cybercriminals, have become thetarget of US prosecution. History:BlackLock (aka El Dorado) has shown explosive growth since emerging in March 2024. Threat intel firm ReliaQuest predicts it may overtake RansomHub as the most active ransomware group this year. How it works:The group stands apart by developing its own custom malware — a hallmark of top-tier groups like “Play” and “Qilin,” according to ReliaQuest. Its malware targets Windows,VMware ESXi(virtualized servers), and Linux environments. Attackers typically encrypt data while also exfiltrating sensitive information, threatening to publish sensitive information if extortionate demands are not met. Targeted victims:BlackLockhas targeted a wide variety of victims, including US-based real estate, manufacturing, and healthcare organizations. Attribution:BlackLock is highly active on the RAMP forum, a Russian-language platform focused on ransomware, actively recruiting for various roles, including initial access brokers, who sell access to partially compromised networks to its affiliates. There is no definitive attribution for the makeup of the BlackLock ransomware group. History:TheCl0p ransomwarehas a complex history dating back to 2019. Its widespread misuse over the past six years is primarily associated with Russian-speaking cybercrime groups, primarily TA505 and FIN11. How it works:Cl0p exploits zero-day vulnerabilities to target its prey. The Cl0p group tends to avoid using conventional payloads but still relies on a leak site to extort payment from victims. “We’ve seen the group use high-profile platform vulnerabilities with minimal downtime to exfiltrate data, such as exploiting avulnerability in Cleo file transfer software,” according to Rapid7’s Beek. Targeted victims:Cl0p has targeted major organizations worldwide. Most notoriously, Cl0p conducted a massive campaign exploiting theMOVEit vulnerability, affecting thousands of organizations in 2023. Attribution:The Cl0p ransomware is attributed to several (mostly Russian speaking) cybercriminal groups. History:FunkSecis a new RaaS group that emerged in late 2024, claiming more than 85 victims in December alone. How it works:FunkSec uses AI in its malware development, demands low ransoms, and has “questionable credibility regarding their data leaks,” according to Rapid7’s Beek. Targeted victims:FunkSec has claimed a large number of victims, but researchers caution some of the leaks may be rehashed or recycled from earlier breaches. Attribution:FunkSec operates as a RaaS model, likely with Russian-speaking affiliates. History:LockBitis a cybercrime group operating through a ransomware-as-a-service model it was instrumental in pioneering. Despite being disrupted in 2024,LockBithas shown signs of a comeback. The malware operation remains notorious for its efficient encryption and double extortion tactics. How it works: LockBit, despite a majortakedown operationby law enforcement last year, continues to use the evermore powerful RaaS model as well as double extortion, also known as “lock and leak.” “LockBit continues to list victims, recruit affiliates, and try to reclaim its reputation on dark web forums,” Luke Donovan, head of threat intelligence, Searchlight Cyber tells CSO. Targeted victims:LockBit targeted thousands of victims worldwide in its heyday, including government services, private sector companies, and critical infrastructure providers. Attribution:LockBit’s use of Russian-language forums and targeting patterns have led some analysts to believe the group is based in Russia. Russian national Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev,named by Western law enforcement agencies last yearas the developer and administrator of LockBit,faces a US indictment alongside asset freezes and travel bans. Two Russian nationals were indicted for deploying LockBit ransomware against targeted organizations. History:Lynxshares 48% of its source code with the earlier INC ransomware, which indicates a plausible rebranding or evolution of the same threat actor. How it works:Lynx also operates a RaaS and employs double extortion tactics. After infiltrating a system, the ransomware can steal sensitive information and encrypt the victim’s data, effectively locking them out. To make recovery more difficult, it adds the ‘.lynx’ extension to encrypted files and deletes backup files like shadow copies. Targeted victims:Since emerging, the ransomware has actively targeted several US and UK industries, including retail, real estate, architecture, financial services, and environmental services. The group behind Lynx attacked multiple facilities across the US between July 2024 and November 2024, which include victims associated with energy, oil, and gas, according to Palo Alto’s Unit 42 threat intel group. “According to a statement Lynx released in July 2024, they claim to be ‘ethical’ with regards to choosing victims,” Rapid7’s Beek adds. Attribution:Lynx operates as a RaaS model, meaning it is likely used by multiple cybercriminals rather than a single entity. History:Medusais a ransomware-as-a-service operation that debuted in 2022. How it works:The group typically hacks into systems by either exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing assets, phishing emails, or using initial access brokers. Targeted victims:Cybercriminals behind Medusa have targeted healthcare, education, manufacturing, and retail organizations in the US, Europe, and India. Attribution:Activity on Russian-language cybercrime forums related to Medusa suggests the core group and many of its affiliates may be from Russia or neighbouring countries but this remains unconfirmed. History:Playis a ransomware threat that emerged in June 2022. The group intensified its activities following the disruption of other major threat actors. How it works:Attackers typically encrypt systems after exfiltrating sensitive data. Play keeps a fairly low profile on thedark webaside from its leak site, not advertising itself on dark web forums. “It has even claimed not to be an RaaS gang at all, saying it maintains a ‘closed group to guarantee the secrecy of deals,’ in spite of evidence to the contrary,” Searchlight Cyber’s Donovan explains. Targeted victims:The group has targeted various sectors, including healthcare, telecommunications, finance, and government service. Attribution:Play may have connections to North Korean state-aligned APT groups. In October 2024, security researchers atPalo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 published evidence of a deployment of Play ransomware by a threat actor backed by North Korea, specifically APT45. “The link between this threat actor and Play is unclear, but demonstrates the potential for crossover between state-sponsored cyber activity and ostensibly independent cybercrime networks,” Donovan says. History:Qilin, also known as Agenda, is a Russia-based RaaS group that has been operating since May 2022. How it works:The group targets Windows and Linux systems, including VMware ESXi servers, using ransomware variants written in Golang and Rust. Qilin follows a double extortion model — encrypting victims’ files and threatening to leak stolen data if the ransom is not paid. Targeted victims:Qilin recruits affiliates on underground forums and prohibits attacks on organizations in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries bordering present-day Russia. Attribution:The makeup of Qilin remains unknown but a Russian-speaking organized cybercrime operation is strongly suspected. History:RansomHubemerged in February 2024 and quickly became a major cyber threat. The group, initially known as Cyclops and later Knight, rebranded and expanded its operations by recruiting affiliates from other disrupted ransomware groups such as LockBit and ALPHV/BlackCat. How it works:Once inside a network, RansomHub affiliates exfiltrate data and deploy encryption tools, often utilizing legitimate administrative utilities to facilitate their malicious activities. RansomHub operates an “affiliate-friendly” RaaS model, initially offering a fixed 10% fee for those that make attacks using its ransomware and the option to collect ransom payments directly from victims before paying the core group. “These elements make it an attractive option for affiliates that are looking for a guaranteed return, where other RaaS operations have been unreliable in paying out in the past,” Searchlight Cyber’s Donovan says. Targeted victims:RansomHub has been linked to more than 210 victims across various critical sectors, including healthcare, finance, government services, and critical infrastructure in Europe and North America, according to Rapid7. Attribution:Attribution remains unconfirmed but circumstantial evidence points toward an organized Russian-speaking cybercrime operation with ties to other established ransomware threat actors.
