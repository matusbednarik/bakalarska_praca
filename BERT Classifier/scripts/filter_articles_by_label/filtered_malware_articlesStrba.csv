attack compromised account tied first place also followed closely application exploit despite phishing simulation security awareness training user dont seem getting better spotting phishing email according fortras global phishing benchmark report also released february user click phishing email year ago click give password malicious site dont think training program work say brian spanswick ciso head cohesity phishing simulation every quarter percentage stay there pattern didnt click ai making social engineering attack much cleverer confidence even lower even though user trained cybersecurity warned phishing simulation happening still click spanswick say weve couple year seems pretty constant right around previous company industry standard solution put control place keep

demanded hacker gone hundred dollar hundred thousand even million case increasingly stringent regulatory requirement cisos sued reporting breach stake ransomware attack getting ever higher specialist say enterprise avoid getting situation first place creating incident response plan improving cybersecurity posture investing robust backup data infrastructure shelley incident response lead coalition conversation executive technical team company hit ransomware attack brought company standstill ransom ceo said im losing million day chicken feed pay pay recall first started dealing ransomware company paid ransom usually couple hundred dollar time theyve gotten larger exorbitant say rarely would see ransom south six figure quite frequently seven eight figure according report released july

attack hit record level june increase time year good news according coverware percentage ransomware attack victim paid fell record low company creating incident response plan improving cybersecurity posture investing robust backup data infrastructure two main reason company pay money cybercriminals first dont way recover ransomware recovery would take much time one case involved medical device manufacturer informed u day away issue layoff notification something didnt dramatically change say heath renfrow cofounder fenix cyber disaster recovery firm paying ransom able recover enough data system ceo canceled layoff say company worked last month would close door didnt pay ransom say necessarily advocating paying ransom understand truly business decision ethic paying ransom aside tough position many people livelihood time life critical infrastructure stake second main reason company pay criminal threaten release sensitive data steve stone head zero lab rubrik worked numerous client whove hit ransomware attack sometimes data sensitive reducing risk released amount worth money number organization paid extortion ransom try protect data even mean there still chance leaked say course cant trust bad guy keep word data still sold back channel even dumped dark web still count breach whether attacker publish stolen data victim still notified data critical enough company may feel everything keep getting company might also decide paying ransom might save money recovery cost considered might actually case according ibm report released late july global average cost ransomware

6 reasons why your anti-phishing strategy isn’t working,https://www.csoonline.com/article/574749/6-reasons-why-your-anti-phishing-strategy-isn-t-working.html,reason antiphishing strategy isnt working phishing successful scam likely stay get effective overreliance technology confusing counterproductive training six reason antiphishing strategy might failing phishing attempt typically like fishing barrel given enough time bad actor likely reel victim recognize organization habitually vulnerable continue target barrelfishing cycle go bad actor highly motivated funded sole attempt successful attracting one victim say johanna baum ceo founder strategic security solution consulting however organization tasked protecting potential victim overlooking misjudging security hygiene greatly increase susceptibility attack even following pristine protocol offered training employee repeatedly remind staff verify suspicious communication keep latest nefarious campaign fool unwary organization always vulnerable six reason antiphishing strategy isnt working phishing attack becoming believable sophisticated cybercriminals continuously developing new tactic trick people giving sensitive information result phishing attack becoming sophisticated say krissy safi managing director global practice leader attack penetration testing protiviti many antiphishing solution use static rule detect phishing attack easily bypassed attacker using advanced technique safi say also introduction chatgpt proliferation phishing email perfect grammar broken english thus making even difficult identify phishing email sent cybercriminal chatgpt opensource version available perpetrator company stolen communication become panacea scammer ai learn real time work doesnt increasing chance one attack find willing target even without employing chatbots attacker getting proficient take breach cloud communication company twilio example case attacker able match employee name phone number using publicly available database social engineering attack succeeded fooling employee providing credential twilio said incident report attacker used stolen credential gain access internal system able access certain customer data many organization trying solve phishing problem solely technology company buying latest tool detect suspicious email giving employee way report block suspicious email say eric liebowitz chief information security officer america thales group parisbased company develops device equipment technology aerospace space transportation defense security industry one big thing dont think enough organization focusing training employee liebowitz say could greatest tool place theyre training employee thats bad thing going happen organization deployed right tool workflow

automatically blocked say siem security information event management soar security orchestration automation response technology organization deploy specific playbook response identified potential phishing campaign opposed manual work analyst organization failed antiphishing strategy take holistic defenseindepth strategy haney say may focus particular technology email antiphishing multifactor authentication data encryption endpointmobile security look others mitigate risk along cyber kill chain example detecting compromised identity say problem implementing holistic defenseindepth strategy relying solely antiphishing program take one successful attack bring entire system say lexmark ciso bryan willett trusting emailbased defense approach relying heavily training user inherently flawed people prone making mistake take one attacker succeed best way defend phishing attack layered defense approach say willett includes good endpoint detection response edr system every workstation strong vulnerability management program enabling multifactor authentication every user admin account well implementing segmentation across lanwan limit spread infected system taking precaution implementing multiple layer defense organization best protect phishing attack willett add must assume attacker succeed point therefore need defend assumption mind using comprehensive layered defense approach failing train employee recognize phishing attempt training employee click link open attachment email unknown sender critical employer must also educate worker recognize fraudulent email say jim russell chief information officer manhattanville college harrison new york one thing talk training authentic voice one important element recognizing fraudulent email say russell also function institution ciso however folk communicate kind personally quickly email one security gap luckily academic community folk writing complete sentence may standard salutation example hi lauren typical kind introduction thing missing there lack authenticity manhattanville college employee also trained forward suspicious email member russell team determine authenticity dell technology ciso kevin cross agrees successful antiphishing strategy need start raising employee awareness identify phishing email understand report approach shift common dont click strategy used many company achieving zeroclick rate impractical unrealistic goal cross say instead teaching employee report suspicious email allows security team quickly assess potential threat mitigate effect others targeted similar attack organization embed tool email platform make easier worker report suspicious email cross say however type training doesnt go far enough say jacob ansari national pci practice leader cybersecurity practice mazars global audit tax advisory firm antiphishing strategy limited effectiveness target tip proverbial iceberg user behavior say training user spot phishing attack effective long phishing scheme distinguishable legitimate business activity say antiphishing effort quickly undone employee expected engage kind activity bear similarity phishing scheme example company requires user click link sent thirdparty sender complete background check enroll benefit entering personal information web form hosted elsewhere regular business practice diminishes value antiphishing training say addition training user ansari say organization need engage business leader reengineer business process longer appear similar phishing scheme minimizing use clickthrough link email requiring thirdparty interaction employee follow company standard secure communication company also need ensure part business human resource marketing finance engage third party companywide communication responsible manner avoids condition allow phishing scheme thrive say even company strong training program policy place may effective consequence employee violate policy safi say example employee fall phishing email fails report consequence encourage better behavior future manhattanville college employee fall phishing email must complete certain number online training session day russell say click link get one training session however actually give credential complete three also review list people fell phishing attempt identify folk enhanced privilege vice president russell add get five minute penalty box tell there geneva convention protect also track repeat offender failed training also get five minute penalty box one awkward conversation much reliance simulated phishing test another achilles heel current antiphishing strategy company aim train user infallible say sushila nair head cybersecurity service capgemini there widely held premise end user blame falling phishing attack say however organization must ask truly looking measuring value say must aim user falling simulated phishing test test sophisticated fail test fairly easy everyone pas flying color add lure presenting improved userinfallibility metric board meeting tempting cisos however leader must accept small percentage user click link matter much company train stressful time number increase even worse many organization run simulated phishing test normalize clicking link nair say click link may take portal say well darn fooled nair say forcing user training part simulation reverse effect likely click link thrown training clicked link busy stressful day teach user hate training session get without paying attention quickly possible add nair effect impact way user might react phishing email say wont click odd email think test also wont report either bottom line antiphishing program often fail people fallible people make mistake despite training best effort say elizabeth shirley attorney cochair

establishing credibility especially also make data theft claim large company keep firm retainer many organization dont often feel lost facing ransomware attack end losing precious time case better

process includes running briefing internally organization leadership helping victim organization make contact insurance carrier notify attack get approval cost including counsel forensics crisis

Ransomware recovery: 8 steps to successfully restore from backup,https://www.csoonline.com/article/571131/ransomware-recovery-8-steps-to-successfully-restore-from-backup.html,ransomware recovery step successfully restore backup best way recover ransomware attack reliable fast backup process here according ransomware survey report released june keeper security company hit ransomware paid ransomand another declined say whether paid part reason lack backupsspecifically lack usable backup backup must safe malware quick easy recover include important file database also key application configuration technology needed support entire business process importantly backup welltested eight step ensure successful recovery backup ransomware attack according survey veritas released last fall company three copy data including least one offsite keeping air gap backup production environment critical keep safe ransomwareand disaster see client onprem backup run well cloudbased one say jeff palatt vice president technical advisory service moxfive technical advisory service company ideally someone dont cascade encrypted file get written local backup solution get replicated cloud doesnt good cloudbased platform include versioning part product additional cost example office google doc online backup system like idrive keep previous version file without overwriting even ransomware strike encrypted file backed backup process add new corrupted version fileit doesnt overwrite older backup already technology save continuous incremental backup file also mean there loss data ransomware hit go back last good version file attack another way protect backup use storage cant written use either physical writeoncereadmany worm technology virtual equivalent allow data written changed increase cost backup since requires substantially storage backup technology save changed updated file use deduplication technology keep multiple copy thing archive many case enterprise dont storage space capability keep backup lengthy period time say palatt one case client three day backup two overwritten third day still viable ransomware hit say long holiday weekend three day backup could destroyed sudden come iteration overwritten three four five day addition keeping backup file safe attacker company also ensure data catalog safe sophisticated ransomware attack target backup catalog actual backup medium backup tape disk people think say amr ahmed ey america infrastructure service resiliency leader alaska kodiak island borough hit ransomware municipality three dozen server employee pc backed say supervisor paul vandyke ran recovery effort server backed except one missed one server assessed property value say ransom demand small today standard half bitcoin worth paid ransom used decryption key one server since didnt trust integrity system restored attacker help assumed everything dirty say today everything covered backup technology larger organization also problem ensuring everything need backed actually backed according veritas survey professional estimate average wouldnt able recover data event complete data loss doesnt help many company company problem shadow people trying job convenient efficient way possible say randy watkins cto critical start oftentimes mean running radar thing there much company prevent loss critical data sitting server back closet somewhere especially data used internal process come production usually hit company radar somewhere say watkins there new application new revenuegenerating service system easily found backed ransomware hit suddenly thing longer working watkins recommends company thorough survey system asset usually involve leader every function ask people list critical system data need protected ransomware doesnt affect data file attacker know business function shut likely company pay ransom natural disaster hardware failure network outage dont discriminate either hit ransomware kodiak island vandyke rebuild server pc sometimes included downloading reinstalling software redoing configuration result took week restore server another week restore pc addition three spare server recovery lot swapping back forth say server process could gone faster backing data without backing software component dependency configuration networking setting monitoring security tool everything else required business process work make recovery extremely challenging company often underestimate challenge there lack understanding technology infrastructure interconnection say burg insufficient understanding technology really work enable business biggest infrastructure recovery challenge ransomware attack typically involve rebuilding active directory rebuilding configuration management database capability burg say used company wanted full backup system data would build working duplicate entire infrastructure disaster recovery site course doubled infrastructure cost making cost prohibitive many business today cloud infrastructure used create virtual backup data center one cost money used company already cloud setting backup different availability zoneor different cloudis even simpler process cloudbased hotswap architecture available cost effective secure great deal promise say burg according veritas director think recover ransomware attack within five day know company spending lot money tape sending iron mountain say watkins dont time wait hour get tape back day restore hot site one thats available switch key would solve recovery time problem today cloudbased infrastructure there reason one nobrainer say watkins script copy infrastructure stand another availability zone another provider altogether automation ready go hit play there restore time minute turn maybe full day go testing arent company first there substantial cost initial setup watkins say need expertise house automation expertise cloud expertise general say thing like security control need set ahead time also legacy system dont transfer cloud watkins point oil gas controller example something cant replicated cloud part initial cost setting backup infrastructure moot point watkins say cost set infrastructure much less paying ransomware dealing reputation damage according veritas company last tested disaster recovery plan three month agoor never tested lot people approaching backup backup point view recovery point view say

hunter internal threat hunting capability becoming necessity many organization common thing look respond incident threat hunting isnt biggest organization anymore solarwinds attack demonstrated size company vulnerable stealthy attacker worm way enterprise even company asset interest foreign spy financially motivated cybercriminals use access point evasion technique according ibms cost data breach report average organization take day detect contain breach caused malicious attack longer attacker stay inside system money cost according ibm cost company additional million take day detect breach first started security operation threat hunting sounded cool something advanced team orlando say optional high profile breach would discovered unless skilled investigator know hunt threat there awareness optional admits hard find experienced threat hunter especially smaller midsized firm lot thing smaller organization get started something either dontits continuum something like solarwinds happens say take ability able read report think happened assess threat could show organization apply knowledge thats isthe key getting started orlando say tends challenge medium smaller organization security team benefit software development team system administrator make sure theyre speed modern cyber threat say orlando theyre front line maintaining system maintaining software like solarwinds might position identify something doesnt look right threat hunter always something really go action there indicator compromise maybe fireeye corporate asset turn sale dark web maybe company learns indicator attacker used compromised solarwinds software entry point maybe alert intrusion detection system honeypot supplier complains money sent never arrived could something big obvious like ransomware attack threat hunter determine extent threat find initial entry point close find shut backdoor time bomb may installed attacker fully cleaned environment many system autorun functiona set instruction executes time device turned example malware detected computer deleted autorun might reinstall checking autorun instruction set ensures malware doesnt come back also way spot suspicious activity system corporate network going thousand thing say orlando every computer going list pull list together every single day compare one day next start pick thing unusual dont look right take little skill dont always know need look say also take planning threat hunter cant comb log arent attacker modified cover track enterprise need make copy log store safe location siem theyre available needed later figuring keep challenge orlando say want visibility get log network data time modern network thats potentially tall order generating ton ton data every single day always financially viable collect everything lately attacker using autoruns cleverly execute malware without ever installing anything thats showing recent spate attack leveraged microsoft exchange vulnerability say john hammond senior security researcher huntress oftentimes would see following compromise exchange server ransomware even common cryptocurrency miner say slower way making money compared immediate loud blatant ransomware since slow method malware hidden extremely well cite recent example local government customer theyre aware news report saw strange traffic hammond say alert coming machine malware

5 reasons why the cost of ransomware attacks is rising,https://www.csoonline.com/article/565518/what-does-a-ransomware-attack-cost-beware-the-hidden-expenses.html,reason cost ransomware attack rising ransom still tiny portion total cost ransomware attack associated cost increasing many organization end paying million ransomware related cost like united health service uhs last year following september attack crippled network organization however example increasingly heavy financial toll attack begun exact victim past two year security expert following trend point several factor driving increased cost associated ransomware attack especially organization healthcare sector one obvious increase average ransom attacker demanding victim analysis claim data policyholder cyber insurance firm coalition last year showed average ransom demand jumping q q like operator maze ransomware strain hit victim average ransom demand study coveware found actual ransomware payouts skyrocketing toofrom q q however ransom part total cost often factor organization refuse accede extortion attempt even organization cost attack increased steadily past two year according security expert five common reason happened downtime cost downtime emerged one biggestif biggestcosts associated ransomware attack ransomware victim often take day sometimes even week restore system following ransomware attack time normal service seriously disrupted resulting lost business lost opportunity cost lost customer goodwill broken slas brand erosion slew problem bulk uhss cost instance tied lost income inability provide patient care service usual billing delay issue could get even worse recent month adversary begun targeting operational technology network maximize downtime victim increase pressure pay one example attack earlier year packaging giant westrock company impacted operation company mill converting plant similar attack honda temporarily disrupted operation automaker plant outside japan twothirds respondent survey nearly professional veritas commissioned last year estimated would take organization least five day recover ransomware attack another report coveware pegged average downtime substantially higher average day q ryan week ciso datto say survey company last year showed average cost downtime related ransomware attack startling higher one year ago downtime often immensely costly ransom say rate cost downtime increasing really put ransomware epidemic perspective company data showed average downtime ransomware attack cost upwards much higher average ransom demand make tempting organization simply accede attacker demand week say example city atlanta georgia hit ransomware attack cost city upwards million dollar recover however ransom payment say number point need organization wellconsidered cyber resilience strategy business continuity plan week say considering business continuity plan organization need think issue like recovery time objective rtothe maximum duration time within business operation must restoredand recovery point objective rpohow far back time need go retrieve data still usable format calculating rto help determine maximum time business afford operating without access data risk alternatively specifying rpo know often need perform data backup say especially troubling development ransomware operator begun stealing large
