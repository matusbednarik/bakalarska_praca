victim paid ransom four time last year rub salt wound organization paid didnt receive decryption key problem recovering file asset ransomware around long time still paying part reason lack backup specifically lack usable backup backup must safe malware quick easy recover include important file database also key application configuration technology needed support entire business process importantly backup welltested eight step ensure successful recovery backup ransomware attack according thesophos survey case ransomware actor attempted compromise backup attempt successful attacker able successfully compromise backup average ransom payment million compared million company whose backup werent compromised addition company whose backup compromised twice likely pay ransom versus compromised backup also eight time higher recovery cost separate ransom payment million versus see client onprem backup run well cloudbased one say jeff palatt former vice president technical advisory service moxfive technical advisory service company ideally someone dont cascade encrypted file get written local backup solution get replicated cloud doesnt good cloudbased platform include versioning part product additional cost example office google doc online backup system like idrive keep previous version file without overwriting even ransomware strike encrypted file backed backup process add new corrupted version fileit doesnt overwrite older backup already technology save continuous incremental backup file also mean there loss data ransomware hit go back last good version file attack another way protect backup use storage cant written use either physical writeoncereadmany worm technology virtual equivalent allow data written changed increase cost backup since requires substantially storage backup technology save changed updated file use deduplication technology keep multiple copy thing archive according report released june byveeam many company already using immutable storage according survey company use hardened disk onpremises use immutable cloud however overall backup storage used company immutable mean rest high risk ransomware many case enterprise dont storage space capability keep backup lengthy period time say palatt one case client three day backup two overwritten third day still viable ransomware hit say long holiday weekend three day backup could destroyed sudden come iteration overwritten three four five day palatt suggests company keep different type backup full backup one schedule combined incremental backup frequent schedule addition keeping backup file safe attacker company also ensure data catalog safe sophisticated ransomware attack target backup catalog actual backup medium backup tape disk people think say amr ahmed ey america infrastructure service resiliency leader catalog contains metadata backup index bar code tape full path data content disk backup medium unusable without catalog ahmed say restoring without one would extremely hard impractical enterprise need ensure place backup solution includes protection backup catalog air gap alaska kodiak island borough hit ransomware municipality three dozen server employee pc backed say company former supervisor paul vandyke ran recovery effort server backed except one missed one server assessed property value say ransom demand small today standard half bitcoin worth paid ransom used decryption key one server since didnt trust integrity system restored attacker help assumed everything dirty say today everything covered backup technology larger organization also problem ensuring everything need backed actually backed according veritas survey professional estimate average wouldnt able recover data event complete data loss doesnt help many company company problem shadow people trying job convenient efficient way possible say randy watkins cto critical start oftentimes mean running radar thing there much company prevent loss critical data sitting server back closet somewhere especially data used internal process come production usually hit company radar somewhere say watkins there new application new revenuegenerating service system easily found backed ransomware hit suddenly thing longer working watkins recommends company thorough survey system asset usually involve leader every function ask people list critical system data need protected often company discover thing stored shouldnt stored like payment data stored employee laptop result backup project often run concurrent data loss prevention project watkins say ransomware doesnt affect data file attacker know business function shut likely company pay ransom natural disaster hardware failure network outage dont discriminate either hit ransomware kodiak island vandyke rebuild server pc sometimes included downloading reinstalling software redoing configuration result took week restore server another week restore pc addition three spare server recovery lot swapping back forth say server process could gone faster business process work like orchestra say dave burg cybersecurity leader ey america different part orchestra making different sound theyre sequence hear noise backing data without backing software component dependency configuration networking setting monitoring security tool everything else required business process work make recovery extremely challenging company often underestimate challenge there lack understanding technology infrastructure interconnection say burg insufficient understanding technology really work enable business biggest infrastructure recovery challenge ransomware attack typically involve rebuilding active directory rebuilding configuration management database capability burg say used company wanted full backup system data would build working duplicate entire infrastructure disaster recovery site course doubled infrastructure cost making cost prohibitive many business today cloud infrastructure used create virtual backup data center one cost money used company already cloud setting backup different availability zoneor different cloudis even simpler process cloudbased hotswap architecture available cost effective secure great deal promise say burg according sophos ransomware victim fully recovered within week third take month longer recover know company spending lot money tape sending iron mountain say watkins dont time wait hour get tape back day restore hot site one thats available switch key would solve recovery time problem today cloudbased infrastructure there reason one nobrainer say watkins script copy infrastructure stand another availability zone another provider altogether automation ready go hit play there restore time minute turn maybe full day go testing arent company first there substantial cost initial setup watkins say need expertise house automation expertise cloud expertise general say thing like security control need set ahead time also legacy system dont transfer cloud watkins point oil gas controller example something cant replicated cloud part initial cost setting backup infrastructure moot point watkins say cost set infrastructure much less paying

crucial decision influence ciso ultimately determining chosen course leonard kleinman ciso enablis managed service provider australia say enterprise often cooperate based costbenefit analysis look basic economics perspective simply cost versus benefit equation say simple analysis tell compare value organization revenue yearly basis whatever case versus ransomware cost going pointed thecolonial pipeline attackin may example u fuel transportation company paid ransom inbitcoin equivalent u million drop bucket given madeus billion previous year company would lost significantly continued disruption operation referencing ransomware attack onkaseya switzerland derek gooh ciso singapore grocery retailer ntuc add direct cost lost business also opportunity cost restoration imagine recover

insurer want cut loss quickly possible often allow ransom paid knowing full honor amongst thief history return payment get organization back operating quickly say enablis kleinman explains business must also consider legal regulatory liability risk intertwined financial consequence especially larger company say giving example ransomware operator encrypts corporation data go stock exchange listed oh way know acme xyz encrypted say kleinman explains regulatory risk publicly listed company must perform continuous disclosure given material price stock ransomware group informs stock exchange company may violation policy exposing regulatory scrutiny punishment paying ransomware involved costbenefit analysis would likely compliance demand however ethic paying ransomware operator much oblique giving enterprise additional factor consider newton secondwave say stance would pay ransom ransomware operator think money end think fund say although ransomware operator criminal ultimate aim diverse purely profit others may connected rogue nation north korea mercuryits haigh note ransomware operator may even sanctioned entity authority u department treasury weve seen example uk u even
