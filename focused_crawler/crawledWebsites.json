Ultimately, this has the same net effect as the problem described in the previous section, but this time restricting the techniques which can be used rather than what can be targeted. This ends up stifling your team’s creativity, leading to a less effective engagement that results in poorer understanding of your security posture than you otherwise would have been able to gain.

This doesn’t constrain the team to what specific persistence mechanism they have to use, or which type of file share they must target, leaving them space to be creative but still tying the overall theme to a threat that you may be asked about by the board or your boss.",

I’ve seen more mature organizations break these engagements out into entirely separate projects, sometimes chaining them together to tell a story. One of my favorite examples of this was a financial organization that ran two initial access projects — phishing and external attack surface exploitation — concurrently for eight weeks. The results from these engagements, which included the users who detonated the phishing payload and the external systems on which the team had gotten code execution, became the beachheads onto which access for the red team was ceded.",

The agreement, if approved by a federal judge in Manhattan, will resolve a class-action lawsuit was that filed against the company in July 2020 regarding two security breaches that compromised the personal data of approximately 15 million customers. According to claimants, Morgan Stanley failed to protect the personally identifiable information (PII) of current and former clients. It is alleged data center equipment decommissioned by the firm in 2016 and 2019 was not efficiently wiped clean and a software flaw meant that unencrypted, sensitive data was visible to whoever purchased the equipment.",

It targeted multiple vulnerabilities to help it spread faster and further. While not designed to do harm, it was probably the first malware to do real substantive financial damage, more than earning its place on this list. It spread incredibly swiftly — within 24 hours of its release,it had infected 10% of all internet-connected computers— and created multiple copies of itself on each machine, causing many of them to grind to a halt. Estimates of the costs of the attack ranged into the millions.",

But the malware so cleverly took advantage of a number of flaws in Windows 95 — especially the fact that Windows automatically hid the file extensions of email attachments so people didn’t realize they were launching executable files — that it spread like wildfire, and soon millions of infected computers were sending out copies of the worm andbeaming passwords back to a Filipino email address.

These “Nigerian prince” emails have been a running joke for decades, but they’re still an effective social engineering technique that people fall for: in 2007 the treasurer of a sparsely populated Michigan county gave $1.2 million in public funds to such a scammer in the hopes of personally cashing in. Another common lure is the prospect of a new, better job, which apparently is something far too many of us want: in a hugely embarrassing 2011 breach, the security company RSA was compromised when at least two low-level employees opened a malware file attached to a phishing email with the file name “2011 recruitment plan.xls.”",

This all happened in 1979, and you’d think things would’ve improved since then, but you’d be wrong: in 2016, a hacker got control of a U.S. Department of Justice email address and used it to impersonate an employee, coaxing a help desk into handing over an access token for the DoJ intranet by saying it was his first week on the job and he didn’t know how anything worked.",

For instance, in 2015 finance employees at Ubiquiti Networks wired millions of dollars in company money to scam artists who were impersonating company executives, probably using a lookalike URL in their email address. On the lower tech side, investigators working for British tabloids in the late ’00s and early ’10s often found ways to get access to victims’ voicemail accounts by pretending to be other employees of the phone company via sheer bluffing; for instance, one PI convinced Vodafone to reset actress Sienna Miller’s voicemail PIN by calling and claiming to be “John from credit control.”",

As research illustrates, cyber operations are imperfect tools for controlling escalation via signaling. Scholarshave arguedthat cyber operations are used to signal all the time, perhaps because there is little chance of them leading to escalation. Retaliatory cyber offensive capabilities are rarely “ready to go” or even existent at the time they are needed to react to crisis. Even where they do exist, signaling requires such specificity in target and effects that their impact would be uncertain or limited without further development (which can take too long). Moreover, leaders tend to be concerned that the characteristics of cyber actions directly against foreign governments (i.e., they often seem arbitrary and blunt force) might invite a cross-domain response if targeted too assertively. General unwillingness to use a non-cyber action where digital possibilities exist in some form makes cyber for cyber’s sake an unappealing prospect during crisis.",

This second point is critical for cybersecurity teams, who would do well to be mindful of the temporality of geopolitical crises. Attacks on enterprise firms or civil society organizations by sophisticated cyber actors tend to only come around critical junctures. In particular, they occur during the opening days of a crisis where strategic competitors attempt to define the scope of a situation and the point where conflict clearly evolves into a new phase, such as theweeks following the Battle of Kyivin 2022 when pro-Russian cyberattacks absent since the invasion picked back up. Otherwise, spillover from signaling activities reduces in likelihood in inverse proportion to the rising difficulty of meaningful crisis communication.",

It is easy to envision a future conflict that involves, say, Iran in which the Tehran regime directly leverages their network of proxy actors to hack based on pre-planned eventualities.

Many questions remain regarding who is responsible for choosing the targets and uploading the list, but there is a strong possibility a core group of individuals make these executive decisions. Also peculiar is that unlike any other hacking group in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, NoName057(16) does not restrict its user base and is willing to mix ideology with financial incentives to recruit individuals to join their efforts.",

Iranian drones have featured heavily in Moscow’s aerial campaign against Ukraine’s people and the government in Tehran has been reaping the benefits thereof.

For one, the less an individual goes in and out of their physical wallet, the less opportunity for a card to be left or another card (such as a drivers license or corporate ID) to fall out and become the basis of a compromised identity. Second, digital wallets can be used online in lieu of a credit card or as a way of establishing a profile without creating an account. Some even facilitate the creation of virtual card numbers, which can be used on web sites you don’t trust completely as a safety measure so that physical credit cards and their associated numbers remain secure. This helps minimize an individual’s digital footprint and constrains that footprint to services that maintain high levels of security. In many cases, employees will likely already have digital wallets available as part of their smartphone’s operating system (Apple Pay or Google Wallet). They just need to be educated on the value and potentially how to set it up.",
