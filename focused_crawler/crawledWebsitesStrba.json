As research illustrates, cyber operations are imperfect tools for controlling escalation via signaling.

Retaliatory cyber offensive capabilities are rarely “ready to go” or even existent at the time they are needed to react to crisis. Even where they do exist, signaling requires such specificity in target and effects that their impact would be uncertain or limited without further development (which can take too long). Moreover, leaders tend to be concerned that the characteristics of cyber actions directly against foreign governments (i.e., they often seem arbitrary and blunt force) might invite a cross-domain response if targeted too assertively. General unwillingness to use a non-cyber action where digital possibilities exist in some form makes cyber for cyber’s sake an unappealing prospect during crisis."

In particular, they occur during the opening days of a crisis where strategic competitors attempt to define the scope of a situation and the point where conflict clearly evolves into a new phase, such as the weeks following the Battle of Kyiv in 2022 when pro-Russian cyberattacks absent since the invasion picked back up.

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent targeting of Western technology firms, for instance, companies like Meta dramatically improved their authority as neutral advocates for shared security principles by taking common-sense steps to respond to service disruption, leading conversation about the situation’s technical aspects, and establishing ways to impartially shape the developing crisis (e.g., by supporting refugee funds). In short, geopolitical cybersecurity spillover need not be the random emergency that many envision; it is simply a set of risks that can be modeled, prepared for, and even turned into opportunity."

For example, on December 15, 2022, the group carried out a DDoS attack on the Polish Parliament website after Poland recognized Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism."

The data indicated that paying a ransom has become increasingly less advantageous overall, with an 82.5% decrease in savings from the 2022 to 2023 reports."

This isn’t just about the security function either, and it needs to be spread across an organization, considering what marketing is going to do, what sales is going to do, etc. — how, as a business, you can demonstrate you value your customers and that you want to make it right as quickly and effectively as possible.”"

The timeline of major cyber threat events stretches back nearly four decades, but it is really only the last decade that has seen the widespread proliferation of national cyber forces . As of 2007, only 10 countries had operational cyber commands, three of which were members of the NATO alliance. Just eight years later, that figure jumped to 61 nations, a full two-thirds of which were outside of the NATO alliance. Clearly, national governments have become more willing to see cybersecurity as a key responsibility. States are also cooperating and sharing the burden of securing cyberspace."

Russia’s stockpiles of munitions, armored vehicles, and even basic supplies have been depleted so extensively that the regime is now turning to partners for resupply and even for new capabilities. Iranian drones have featured heavily in Moscow’s aerial campaign against Ukraine’s people and the government in Tehran has been reaping the benefits thereof.

Harris, research director, risk, advisory, management, and privacy at IDC. “Some large organizations and even some smaller local governments are able to draw from an already established pool of funds set aside for these types of events,” he tells CSO. “Large organizations with large amounts of cash on hand can set aside these funds in the event of major events the organization has to deal with. Likewise, smaller local governments that are unable to afford cyber insurance [outright] may have taken it upon themselves to put together a consortium of smaller local governments that each fund a pool of dollars that are used in the event of major cyber events.”"

A positive trigger goes off if something happens, while a negative trigger goes off if something fails to happen. The Stuxnet example is a positive trigger: the worm analyzes the underlying hardware on which it’s running and if it matches the target system it was designed to attack, it spins any attached uranium centrifuges fast enough to destroy them. There are other, somewhat more pedestrian types of positive triggers as well: a logic bomb may go off if someone attempts to open a specified file, for instance, or copy data from one directory to another."

It targeted multiple vulnerabilities to help it spread faster and further. While not designed to do harm, it was probably the first malware to do real substantive financial damage, more than earning its place on this list. It spread incredibly swiftly—within 24 hours of its release, it had infected 10 percent of all internet-connected computers —and created multiple copies of itself on each machine, causing many of them to grind to a halt.

Though NotPetya still looked like ransomware, it was a wiper designed wholly to ruin computers, as the address displayed where users could send their ransom was randomly generated and did no good. Researchers believe that Russian intelligence repurposed the more ordinary Petya malware to use as a cyberweapon against Ukraine—and so, in addition to the massive damage it caused, NotPetya earns its place on this list by illustrating the symbiotic relationship between state sponsored and criminal hackers."

Ideally enterprises should be taking MFA a step further and introducing password-less authentication using zero-trust. Modern authentication strategies like risk-based authentication and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) are also powerful tools in preventing the worst-case scenario from occurring due to a successful phishing attack. Each of these components have a role to play in your organization, but the benefits are two-fold: the damage done from a compromised password is minimized (if not eradicated), and systems are put in place to be able to analyze authentication attempts and react to compromised credentials in real time."

In recent years, cybercriminals have turned to ‘big game hunting,’ targeting large organizations and raking in huge profits.

No need to burn your $2 million iPhone zero-day if you can compromise the same target by exploiting an unpatched web server CVE from 2017.

Major browsers such as Chrome and Firefox will also warn users if they are at risk from MitM attacks. “With the increased adoption of SSL and the introduction of modern browsers, such as Google Chrome, MitM attacks on Public WiFi hotspots have waned in popularity,” says CrowdStrike’s Turedi."

These attacks, in which hundreds or thousands of compromised machines all attempt to access a server or other online resource with legitimate-looking web traffic and knock it out of commission in the process, can’t really happen without a botnet. They’re also relatively easy to launch, as almost any device that can be infected will have internet capabilities and at least a rudimentary web browser."

Hackers turn devices into bots with malware delivered via phishing emails, so make sure your staff knows not to open phishing emails.

According to Ben Smith, field CTO at network security company Netwitness, the flexibility of an organization’s IT architecture will become even more important as new privacy regulations are passed and enforced. “Regardless of your corporate size, if you are charged with securing your global organization, be thinking about your own architecture and where the data is collected, where it lives, and where it is handled,” Smith says."

They found the modifications because of an odd circumstance: The last time any of the baggage scripts had been modified prior to the breach was in December 2012."

The group started out with a skimmer dubbed MakeFrame skimmer that they tested and constantly improved using victims’ websites. This skimmer stood out because it used dual data exfiltration paths to both compromised sites and actor-controlled servers.\nThe researchers have managed to link more recent attacks with a skimmer dubbed Bom to Magecart Group 7. The new skimmer, which has been in use since last year and has been documented by other security firms as well, seems to be a predecessor to MakeFrame and shares similarities with it.

Underground groups are calculating the cost of an attack and implementing ransom pricing strategies based on multiple variables about victim organizations, including the number of infected devices/servers, employees, estimated revenue, and potential impact of media exposure. In doing so, attackers can accurately predict how much victims are likely to pay before they even enter negotiations. Once they do, victim organizations are immediately put on the backfoot. “Normally, in a negotiation, each player holds their cards in their own hands. The ransomware actor knows the cost of their business and how much they need to make to break even. Meanwhile, the victim makes an estimation of the remediation cost,” the blog read. This creates a situation where a victim must traverse an “unfair negotiation game” which guides them to a pre-set but reasonable ransom range without the victim’s knowledge. “It is a rigged game. If the adversary plays well, he will always win. This conclusion ultimately contributes to a rampant ransomware ecosystem.”"

Another common lure is the prospect of a new, better job, which apparently is something far too many of us want: in a hugely embarrassing 2011 breach, the security company RSA was compromised when at least two low-level employees opened a malware file attached to a phishing email with the file name “2011 recruitment plan.xls.”"

This can also worsen when CIOs and CISOs struggle to explain threats, vulnerabilities, and risks in business terms the C-suite can understand and translate into business risks. “The main challenge is for the CISO to be able to express the threats, risks, and solutions in plain language so that non-technical people in the C-suite can understand and act on the CISO’s recommendations,” he says."

The ICO provides a useful self-assessment tool on its website that makes establishing if a breach must be reported easier for organisations. “If you decide you don’t need to report the breach, you need to be able to justify this decision, so you should document it,” says Newman."

The groups coordinating the attacks are highly professionalized and in many ways resemble modern corporate structures with development teams, sales and PR departments, external contractors and service providers that all get a cut from the illegal proceeds. They even use business lingo in their communications with victims, referring to them as clients who buy their data decryption services."

Quite often the threats facing us as individuals are the same, or derivative, of those facing corporations. We see this evidenced in the number of business email compromise (BEC) attacks that are received on employees’ personal devices. The line between our professional and personal lives is increasingly blurred, making a threat to an individual a likely threat to their employer.”"

Though this would represent an unusual payment process outside of standard procedures, the combination of the seemingly genuine email address, personalized wording (e.g., first name) and a quick note along the lines of “whilst not our usual practice, due to an unforeseen error, this payment fell through the cracks and needs paying right away” would, rather easily, create a scenario convincing enough to be processed.

Once the payment goes through, the money is then notoriously difficult to track and recover, and normally ends up in the fraudster’s pocket.

We have seen criminals use the pretext that the small company’s email server can’t be accessed remotely so they are using personal email addresses instead.”"

The victim is asked to send pictures of the front and back of the card with the CVV number exposed so the criminal can use them themselves.”"

Swatters also make use of teletypewriter (TTY) relay services , which are intended to relay text messages from deaf or hard-of-hearing users as voice calls to a third party.

Apparently, criminals used commercially available, voice-generating AI software to impersonate the boss of a German company that owns a UK-based energy firm. The criminals called the UK CEO and tricked him into wiring $243,000 to a supplier in Hungary. The CEO recognized the slight German accent and voice patterns of his boss and the call didn’t arouse suspicion. That’s until the criminals got greedy and called a second time asking for another huge wire transfer. This time, the CEO refused and the ruse began to unravel."

For instance, we all know that there are sometimes errors that arise with automatic payment systems; thus, it’s plausible that some recurring bill we’ve set to charge to our credit card or bank account automatically might mysteriously fail, and the company we meant to pay might reach out to us as a result. An attacker might take on a character we’d expect to meet in that scenario: a friendly and helpful customer service rep, for instance, reaching out to us to help fix the error and make sure the payment goes through before our account goes into arrears. As the scenario plays out, the attacker would ask for bank or credit card information to help the process along — and that’s the information they need to steal money right out from our accounts."

That requires the character be as believable as the situation. It’s not enough to find it plausible in the abstract that you might get a phone call from your cable company telling you that your automatic payment didn’t go through; you have to find it believable that the person on the phone actually is a customer service rep from your cable company. Thus, the most important pretexting techniques are those the scam artist deploys to put you at ease. If an attacker has somehow obtained your cable bill, for example by going through your garbage, they’ll be armed with the name of your cable provider and your account number when they call you, which makes you more likely to believe that they really are the character they’re playing."

That’s why careful research is a foundational technique for pretexters. While dumpster diving might be a good source of intelligence on a victim, it obviously also takes quite a bit of messy real-world work, and may not be worth it for a relatively low-value target. But pretexters have a wealth of other more efficient research techniques available, including so-called open source intelligence — information that can be pieced together from publicly available information ranging from government records to LinkedIn profiles. There’s also gigabytes of personally identifying data out there on the dark web as a result of innumerable data breaches, available for purchase at a relatively low price to serve as a skeleton for a pretexting scenario."

It can be considered a kind of pretexting because the tailgater will often put on a persona that encourages the person with the key to let them into the building — for instance, they could be dressed in a jumpsuit and claim they’re there to fix the plumbing or HVAC, or have a pizza box and say they’re delivering lunch to another floor. Like many social engineering techniques, this one relies on people’s innate desire to be helpful or friendly; as long as there’s some seemingly good reason to let someone in, people tend to do it rather than confront the tailgater."

In some cases, this was as simple as testing to see if the victim had changed their voicemail PIN from the default (a surprising number had not), but they also used a variety of pretexting techniques referred to internally as “blagging” to get access to information , including dumpster diving and bluffing phone company customer service reps to allow access to the voicemail box."

The KnowBe4 blog gives a great example of how a pretexting scammer managed to defeat two-factor authentication to hack into a victim’s bank account . The victim was supposed to confirm with a six-digit code, texted to him by his bank, if he ever tried to reset his username and password; the scammers called him while they were resetting this information, pretending to be his bank confirming unusual charges, and asked him to read the codes that the bank was sending him, claiming they needed them to confirm his identity.
